# Control Plane + RAFT Plan (Draft)

This document outlines how the Felix control plane will use RAFT to manage
cluster metadata and propagate configuration to dataplane brokers. It is not
the data plane and does not carry user payloads.

## Goals
- Consistent cluster metadata (membership, shard placement, config).
- Simple propagation to brokers with clear ownership and failover.
- Keep dataplane hot path free of RAFT overhead.

## Non-Goals
- Replicating stream payloads via RAFT.
- Strong consistency for data reads and writes (handled by dataplane + storage).

## RAFT Scope (Control Plane Only)
The RAFT log stores authoritative metadata:
- Node membership and health state (up/down, drains).
- Stream/shard placement and leadership.
- Cluster-wide config (retention, limits, feature flags).
- Versioned snapshots of metadata state.

All control plane nodes participate in the RAFT group. A single leader accepts
metadata writes and replicates them to followers.

## Propagation to Dataplane
Dataplane brokers do not run RAFT. They consume committed metadata through a
simple API:
- Watch or stream updates (long-poll / streaming RPC).
- Periodic snapshot fetch for resync.

On update:
- Brokers start/stop shard ownership.
- Routing tables update for publish/subscribe paths.
- Health/metrics reflect new assignments.

## Failure + Recovery
- If the control plane leader fails, a new leader is elected by RAFT.
- Brokers reconnect and resume watching from the latest committed version.
- Metadata snapshots allow new control plane nodes to catch up quickly.

## API Sketch (Control Plane)
- `GetSnapshot()` -> full metadata view + version.
- `WatchUpdates(from_version)` -> stream of incremental updates.
- `ReportHealth(node_id, status)` -> node liveness signals. **Implemented** as
  `POST /v1/nodes/{node_id}/heartbeat`; see [Broker liveness](#broker-liveness).

## Broker liveness

A broker registers on boot and then reports health on an interval. Nothing
reports that a broker has *stopped*, so silence is the only signal: a periodic
sweep marks a node `down` once its last heartbeat is older than the timeout.

### `POST /v1/nodes/{node_id}/heartbeat`

Request carries the reporting process's own `incarnation`, from its last
registration. The response returns the node's lifecycle as the cluster sees it,
plus the cadence expected of it:

```json
{ "incarnation": 3 }
{ "node_id": "broker-1", "lifecycle": "live",
  "heartbeat_interval_ms": 5000, "expiry_timeout_ms": 15000 }
```

Four rules, each of which exists for a reason:

- **The recorded time is the control plane's own clock.** A broker that could
  supply it could postpone its own expiry indefinitely.
- **An older `incarnation` is rejected with 409.** A heartbeat delayed past a
  restart belongs to a process the broker has already replaced; counting it
  would report a dead incarnation as live.
- **A heartbeat never revives a `down` node.** It proves a process is running,
  not that it still owns the identity. A broker that reads `"lifecycle": "down"`
  must register again before it is eligible for placement.
- **A heartbeat publishes no change.** Heartbeats arrive per node per interval;
  putting each in the changefeed would evict every real membership change from
  the retention window. Only the lifecycle move that expiry causes is published.

> **Not yet authenticated.** Any caller that can reach this endpoint can report
> health for any `node_id`. Authenticating broker identity is tracked in #126;
> until then it is only safe on a trusted network.

### Broker-side lifecycle

A broker joins a cluster only when `FELIX_NODE_ID` is set. Membership is opt-in
because a single-node broker has no cluster to join, and registering one would
put a node in the catalog that placement would then try to use.

| Env | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FELIX_NODE_ID` | opt-in | Stable across restarts. This is the identity, not the process. |
| `FELIX_NODE_ADVERTISE_ADDR` | with `FELIX_NODE_ID` | `host:port` peers reach this broker on. Not the bind address: a broker bound to `0.0.0.0` has to advertise something routable. |
| `FELIX_CONTROLPLANE_URL` | with `FELIX_NODE_ID` | Where to register. |
| `FELIX_REGION_ID` | no | Defaults to `local`. |

Startup fails, rather than defaulting, when `FELIX_NODE_ID` is set without an
advertised address or a control-plane URL, or when the address does not parse.
A broker that guessed its own address would register something unreachable, and
the failure would surface later as peers unable to connect to a node the catalog
says is live.

The sequence:

1. **Register after the broker can serve.** Advertising a node placement may
   route to before it can answer is worse than advertising it a moment late, so
   registration waits for the initial catalog sync when readiness is gated on it.
2. **Heartbeat** on the interval the control plane returns, with bounded
   exponential backoff and jitter. A failure is visible
   (`felix_broker_heartbeat_failures_total`) but never fatal: a control plane
   that is briefly unreachable must not take down a broker that is serving fine.
3. **Drain, then deregister** on SIGTERM, before connections are drained, so
   nothing new is placed here while in-flight work finishes.

A registration refused with a 4xx — a duplicate advertised address, say — stops
the broker with a clear error instead of retrying. A wrong identity stays wrong,
and retrying only hides the misconfiguration. An unreachable control plane is
retried, because it may simply be starting.

This is what separates a graceful shutdown from a crash: a broker that
deregisters is `left`, and one that simply stops is found `down` by expiry. Both
remove it from placement, but only the first is intentional.

### Configuration

| Setting | Env | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `node_liveness.heartbeat_interval_ms` | `FELIX_NODE_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_MS` | 5000 |
| `node_liveness.expiry_timeout_ms` | `FELIX_NODE_EXPIRY_TIMEOUT_MS` | 15000 |
| `node_liveness.sweep_interval_ms` | `FELIX_NODE_EXPIRY_SWEEP_INTERVAL_MS` | 2000 |

The timeout is three intervals: one lost heartbeat is a hiccup, three is a
pattern. Startup fails if `expiry_timeout_ms` is not greater than
`heartbeat_interval_ms` — a timeout at or below the interval expires brokers
that are heartbeating exactly as told to.

Running several control-plane instances is safe. Each node is claimed by exactly
one sweep and only that instance publishes the change, so duplicate sweeps cost
a query and produce no duplicate events.

## Evolution Plan
1) Control plane RAFT for membership + placement only.
2) Add richer metadata (tenants, quotas, retention).
3) Introduce safety checks for rebalancing and drains.

## Kubernetes Deployment Model
### Pod Layout
- Control plane runs as a dedicated StatefulSet with stable identities.
- Dataplane brokers run as a separate StatefulSet (or Deployment for stateless
  dev mode).
- Object store access is configured per broker (later), not in the control plane.

### Storage
- Control plane uses a PVC per pod for RAFT logs and snapshots.
- Dataplane brokers use PVCs for durable log segments (when enabled).

### Services
- Headless Service for control plane peer discovery (RAFT).
- ClusterIP Service for control plane client API (watch/snapshot/health).
- Separate Service for broker QUIC ingress.

### Scheduling + Ops
- Control plane replicas: 3 or 5 (odd count for quorum).
- Use PodDisruptionBudgets to preserve quorum and shard ownership.
- Prefer anti-affinity for control plane pods to avoid single-node failure.
- Configure liveness/readiness probes on control plane API endpoints.

## Open Questions
- Snapshot cadence and maximum delta size.
- Placement heuristics and rebalancing triggers.
- Authentication/authorization for control plane APIs.
