# Threat model: the broker-internal surface

For [#128](https://github.com/gabloe/felix/issues/128). Covers the M4 forwarding
and M5 replication paths as they exist today, and says which controls are
**present**, which are **absent**, and which are **absent by design pending a
named issue**.

Every claim here was checked against the code. Where a control does not exist,
that is stated plainly rather than described as future work.

## The surface

One listener, separate from the client-facing one
(`services/felix-broker-service/src/peer/server.rs`), speaking `felix-internal/1` over QUIC.
It accepts four families of request:

| Family | Messages | Effect on the receiver |
|---|---|---|
| Handshake | `Hello` | None; names the caller |
| Forwarded publish | `ForwardPublish` | **Appends to a stream's log** |
| Forwarded cache op | `ForwardCacheOp` | Writes a cache key |
| Replication | `ReplicateRecords`, `ReplicateBootstrap`, and their cache, group, dead-letter and counter variants | **Appends to, or replaces the base of, a shard's log** |

## Trust boundary

**There is none yet.** This is the single most important fact in this document
and everything below follows from it.

The listener applies three defences, and `server.rs` is explicit that none of
them is authentication:

1. **A separate port**, with startup refusing a configuration where the peer and
   client listeners share one.
2. **ALPN.** Both ends negotiate `felix-internal/1`; the client-facing endpoint
   negotiates none, so a client pointed at this port fails in the TLS handshake
   before a frame is read.
3. **A distinct magic** (`FLXI` against the client protocol's `FLX1`), so a
   misdirected frame fails to decode rather than parsing into something
   plausible.

All three stop *accidents*. What stops an attacker is **mTLS**, configured
with `FELIX_INTERNAL_TLS_CERT`, `_KEY` and `_CA` (#125): every peer connection
is mutually authenticated against the configured CA, and the certificate's DNS
name is checked against the node id in both directions. A peer with no
certificate, an untrusted or expired one, or one issued to a different name is
refused before any request is read.

**Without those three variables, the security boundary is the network.** The
transport then runs encrypted but unauthenticated — brokers present self-signed
certificates and accept any — and anyone who can reach the peer port is a peer.
Startup warns. Every abuse case below should be read against the mode in use:
under mTLS they describe what a *compromised broker* can do; without it, what
any *reachable* attacker can do, because those are then the same thing.

## Identity

Under mTLS, identity is the certificate. The listener checks the `node_id` a
peer claims in `Hello` against the DNS name on the certificate it presented,
and refuses a mismatch with `Unauthorized` and a closed connection; the
dialling side verifies the listener's certificate against the node id it meant
to reach, so a catalog entry that has been reassigned fails in the handshake
rather than after a `HelloOk`. A broker can therefore speak only as the name
its certificate carries, which is what makes the catalog's node ids trustworthy
across the peer link.

Without mTLS, `Hello` carries a `node_id` and nothing verifies it. The check
runs in the other direction only — `HelloOk`'s id against the node dialled —
and an inbound peer's claimed identity is not used for any decision, which is,
in a narrow sense, a mercy: nothing is granted on the strength of a name nobody
verified.

## Abuse cases

### 1. Publish to any tenant, through the forwarding path — **mitigated (#503)**

A forwarded publish or cache operation carries the client's own bearer token,
and the owner verifies it itself — against the tenant's keys, for the action
the request performs on the stream or cache it names — before it writes
anything (`peer/handler.rs`, `ForwardingHandler::authorize`). A forward with
no credential, a credential that does not verify, or one that does not allow
the action is refused `Unauthorized`. The legacy credential-less kinds are still
decoded, so the refusal is typed rather than a decode failure, but they are
refused all the same.

So the owner's write depends on what the *client* was entitled to, not on
whether the forwarder checked. That is the control #128's acceptance criteria
asked for — *"peer authentication alone is not treated as authorization for
arbitrary tenant operations"* — and it holds today, before #125 and #126 land,
because it does not rest on knowing who the forwarder is at all.

What it does not do: a compromised forwarder that holds a *client's* valid
token can still forward what that client could have published. That is the
client's authority, correctly applied; the token's lifetime and scope bound it.

### 2. Write arbitrary bytes into a shard's log, through replication — **partly mitigated**

The replication path checks more than the forwarding path does:

- **Role.** A broker that is not a replica of the named shard answers
  `Unauthorized` (`replication/replica.rs`).
- **Generation.** A sender at an older epoch is fenced; one naming a newer
  generation than this broker knows is refused rather than believed.
- **Content.** A batch is compared byte-for-byte against what the follower
  already holds, and a mismatch is `LogConflict`.

What those do *not* bound is a sender that names a shard this broker genuinely
replicates, at the generation it genuinely believes, appending records past the
tail. Those are accepted, because that is replication. A reachable attacker can
therefore inject records into any shard this broker is a replica of, and they
will be indistinguishable from the leader's.

**Mitigated under mTLS (#125).** Unlike case 1, peer identity is close to
sufficient here: the role and generation checks already narrow a peer's
authority to shards it is a replica of, so proving the peer *is* that broker
closes most of the gap. Without certificates it stands open.

### 3. Discard a follower's log, through bootstrap — **mitigated**

`ReplicateBootstrap` says "the surviving log begins here", which if accepted
blindly would let a peer truncate a replica. A follower holding records of its
own refuses; only one holding nothing accepts. That refusal is a deliberate
control — discarding records is an operator's decision, not a peer's — and it
holds regardless of authentication.

### 4. Memory exhaustion through declared lengths — **mitigated**

Decoding validates before allocating. `MAX_BODY_BYTES` (64 MiB) bounds a frame
before a buffer is sized from it; `MAX_BATCH_PAYLOADS` (65,536) bounds the
payload count, and the decoder additionally refuses a declared count larger than
the remaining bytes could describe (`declared > body.remaining() / LEN_PREFIX`),
so a small frame cannot claim a large array. `MAX_IDENT_BYTES` (512) bounds
tenant, namespace and stream names.

The fuzz target added in #480 exercises exactly this and found nothing.

### 5. Resource exhaustion through connections — **mitigated**

Per connection, QUIC caps concurrent streams at `max_streams` (default 1024) and
applies flow-control windows.

The connection count is bounded too, since #504: `PeerServer::serve` admits at
most `FELIX_INTERNAL_MAX_INBOUND_CONNECTIONS` (512) in total and
`FELIX_INTERNAL_MAX_INBOUND_PER_SOURCE` (16) from any one address, so neither a
hostile caller nor a peer looping on a reconnect bug can take the listener.
The total alone would not do it — one source would still starve every other
broker before anyone noticed.

`max_inflight_per_peer` is a separate control and does not help here: it is an
*outbound* shed, applied by this broker's pool to requests it is sending.

### 6. Amplification — **low**

A request produces at most one response, and responses are small except for
bootstrap offers, which carry an offset rather than data. The internal protocol
has no request that returns bulk data to the caller; replication pushes rather
than pulls. There is no amplification vector of note.

### 7. Replay — **partly mitigated, by accident**

Nothing in the protocol is nonce-protected. What limits replay is that the
operations are close to idempotent: a replayed `ReplicateRecords` is compared
against stored bytes and answered as a retry; a replayed `ForwardPublish`
**is not** — it appends again, because publishes are not deduplicated.

Idempotent producers (#422) shipped, but on the client-to-broker path only:
`ForwardPublish` carries no producer id or sequence, so the owner has nothing to
deduplicate against and a replayed forwarded publish still duplicates records.
That is within the delivery guarantee Felix documents (`AtLeastOnce`) but is a
capability an attacker has for free.

### 8. Stream exhaustion and malformed payloads — **mitigated**

An undecodable frame ends the stream rather than desynchronising it, and since
#496 a frame with an unknown *kind* is stepped over and refused without dropping
the connection. Neither leaves the reader mid-frame.

## Summary

| # | Abuse case | Status | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Publish to any tenant via forwarding | Mitigated: the owner verifies the client's credential (#503), and mTLS proves which broker forwarded it (#125) | — |
| 2 | Inject records via replication | Mitigated under mTLS (peer identity) plus role + generation | — |
| 3 | Truncate a follower via bootstrap | Mitigated | — |
| 4 | Memory exhaustion via lengths | Mitigated | — |
| 5 | Connection exhaustion | Mitigated: accept-side caps, total and per source (#504) | — |
| 6 | Amplification | Low | — |
| 7 | Replay of a forwarded publish | **Unmitigated**: #422 covers the client-to-broker path only | Producer identity on `ForwardPublish` |
| 8 | Malformed frames | Mitigated | — |

## Residual risk and operating assumptions

**Configure mTLS.** Without `FELIX_INTERNAL_TLS_*` the peer port must be
treated as a trusted network — reachable from other brokers and nothing else —
which is an operational control rather than a product one. With it, a peer is a
broker holding a certificate the cluster's CA issued to its own node id, and
reachability is no longer the boundary.

Connection admission is bounded independently of authentication, because an
authenticated peer looping on a bug exhausts a listener just as a hostile one
does: `FELIX_INTERNAL_MAX_INBOUND_CONNECTIONS` caps the listener and
`FELIX_INTERNAL_MAX_INBOUND_PER_SOURCE` caps any single source.

Tenant authority across a forward is no longer one: the owner verifies the
client's credential itself, so authenticating the peer is about *who is
calling*, not about what may be written.

The milestone signal for this review is *"no unauthenticated internal RPC and no
unencrypted cluster-internal link"*. Both halves are satisfied for a cluster that
configures certificates: QUIC requires TLS, so the link was never unencrypted,
and #125 closed authentication. It is **not** satisfied by default — without the
three variables the peer link is still encrypted but unauthenticated, which is
why startup warns and why every case above is written against both modes.
