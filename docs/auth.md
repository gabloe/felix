# Auth Design: OIDC Exchange + Felix Tokens

This document describes the current Felix authentication and authorization design as implemented in the control plane and the broker. It aligns with the `felix-authz` crate, Casbin RBAC model, and the token exchange flow in the control plane.

Detailed RBAC mutation/delegation rules and canonical grammar are documented in `docs/security/rbac.md`.

## Goals

- Multi-tenant authentication and authorization.
- Support multiple OIDC issuers per tenant.
- Brokers validate only Felix tokens (never upstream IdP tokens).
- Embed effective permissions in Felix tokens for fast broker-side enforcement.

## Components

- **Control plane**: Validates upstream OIDC tokens, evaluates RBAC policies, and mints Felix tokens.
- **felix-authz**: JWT mint/verify utilities and permission parsing/matching shared by control plane and broker.
- **Broker**: Verifies Felix token signature/claims and enforces permissions locally.

## Supported Identity Providers

Felix supports any OIDC-compliant IdP that exposes a JWKS endpoint (either via OIDC discovery or a direct `jwks_url`) and uses an allowed upstream OIDC signing algorithm.

Supported upstream OIDC JWT signing algorithms:
- `ES256` (default)
- `RS256`, `RS384`, `RS512`
- `PS256`, `PS384`, `PS512`

Control plane configuration:
- YAML: `oidc_allowed_algorithms: ["ES256"]`
- Env: `FELIX_CONTROLPLANE_OIDC_ALLOWED_ALGORITHMS=ES256,RS256,...`

This includes common providers like:

- Microsoft Entra ID
- Okta
- Auth0
- Google
- Apple

Other providers are supported as long as they provide standard OIDC discovery or a JWKS URL and the tokens include `iss`, `sub`, and `aud` claims.

## Token Types

### Upstream OIDC token

- Provided by an external IdP (Entra ID, Okta, Auth0, Google, Apple, etc.).
- Validated by the control plane using issuer discovery + JWKS.
- Claims used:
  - `iss` (issuer)
  - `sub` (subject)
  - optional groups/roles claim

### Felix token (JWT)

Minted by the control plane and verified by brokers.

Claims:
- `iss`: `felix-auth`
- `aud`: `felix-broker`
- `sub`: `principal_id` (sha256 of `iss|sub`)
- `tid`: tenant id
- `exp`, `iat`
- `perms`: array of permission strings

Algorithm:
- **EdDSA (Ed25519)** (tenant-specific signing key).
- Header includes `kid`.

## Principal Normalization

- `principal_id = sha256(iss + "|" + sub)` (hex encoding).
- Groups/roles are extracted from a configured claim (optional).
- During token exchange, each extracted group is added as a transient role link:
  - `g, <principal_id>, group:<group_name>, <tenant>`
  - This allows RBAC bindings like `g, group:g1, role:reader, <tenant>`.

## RBAC Model (Casbin)

Casbin is used with domains for tenant scoping.

- **Domain**: tenant id
- **Role link**: `g = user, role, domain`
- **Policy rule**: `p = role, domain, object, action`
- **Matcher**: `keyMatch2` for object pattern matching

Objects:
- Tenant: `tenant:{tenant_id}`
- Namespace: `namespace:{tenant_id}/{namespace}` or `namespace:{tenant_id}/*`
- Stream: `stream:{tenant_id}/{namespace}/{stream}`, `stream:{tenant_id}/{namespace}/*`, or `stream:{tenant_id}/*/*`
- Cache: `cache:{tenant_id}/{namespace}/{cache}`, `cache:{tenant_id}/{namespace}/*`, or `cache:{tenant_id}/*/*`
- Cluster: `cluster:*` — see [Cluster scope](#cluster-scope)
- Node: `node:{node_id}` — one broker

Actions:
- `rbac.view`, `rbac.policy.manage`, `rbac.assignment.manage`
- `tenant.manage` — over `tenant:{tenant_id}` for the tenant's own settings, or
  over `cluster:*` for the tenant catalog (create, list, delete)
- `ns.manage`, `stream.manage`, `cache.manage` — the control plane's resource
  API, over the namespace, stream or cache being changed
- `stream.publish`, `stream.subscribe`
- `cache.read`, `cache.write`
- `node.view` — cluster-scoped only
- `node.manage` — over `node:{node_id}` or `cluster:*`

Consumer-group operations have no action of their own: a group is a read
position over a stream, so poll, acknowledge, hand-back and the dead-letter
requests are all authorized as **`stream.subscribe`** on the stream being read.

### Cluster scope

One object sits outside the tenant hierarchy:

- Cluster: `cluster:*` — broker membership, liveness, and placement standing;
  the tenant catalog; and the metadata feeds brokers seed from.

It is an island in both directions, and that is the whole security property:

- **No tenant scope contains it.** A policy write is admitted only when its
  object is already inside the caller's scope, so a tenant admin cannot grant
  themselves `cluster:*`. Nothing in the bootstrap seed grants it either.
- **It contains no tenant object.** Cluster scope confers nothing inside a
  tenant, so it is not a backdoor into tenant data.

`node.view:cluster:*` is required by `GET /v1/nodes`, `GET /v1/nodes/{node_id}`,
and every `snapshot` and `changes` feed; `tenant.manage:cluster:*` by
`GET`/`POST /v1/tenants` and `DELETE /v1/tenants/{tenant_id}`. The tenant comes
from the token's own `tid` claim rather than a path segment, because the
cluster is not a tenant resource; that claim only selects which tenant's
signing keys to verify against, exactly as `kid` selects a key without
conferring one.

Cluster scope reaches a token only through bootstrap: initialize an operator
tenant with policies granting the cluster actions to a role, assign the
operator principal to it, and exchange. A tenant admin cannot write those rules
later, for the reason above. The full per-endpoint table is in
[control-plane.md](control-plane.md#metadata-api-authorization).

### RBAC Security Model

- RBAC mutation is **not** authorized by resource-management actions.
  - Example: `ns.manage` does not permit policy/grouping writes.
- RBAC APIs are split by intent:
  - list policies/groupings: `rbac.view`
  - mutate policy rules: `rbac.policy.manage`
  - mutate assignments/groupings: `rbac.assignment.manage`
- Delegation is scope-bound:
  - callers can only create/delete rules within their own object scope
  - callers cannot assign a role if any role policy exceeds caller scope
- Write-time validation rejects broad or malformed wildcards (for example `tenant:*`).

### Inheritance Expansion

When building effective permissions for a principal:
- `tenant.manage:tenant:{T}` implies tenant-scoped namespace/stream/cache manage + read/write actions.
- `ns.manage:namespace:{T}/{X}` implies stream/cache manage + read/write within namespace `{X}`.

### Group-Based Role Assignment (from IdP `groups_claim`)

You can assign roles to IdP groups without per-user RBAC bindings:

- Add RBAC grouping rules that bind `group:<name>` to a role.
- Configure `groups_claim` for the tenant IdP issuer.
- At token exchange time, Felix maps each incoming group value to `group:<name>`
  (if not already prefixed) and evaluates RBAC through that link.

Example:
- `g, group:g1, role:reader, tenant-a`
- `p, role:reader, tenant-a, stream:tenant-a/payments/*, stream.subscribe`

## Control Plane Token Exchange Flow

1) Client obtains an upstream OIDC JWT from its IdP.
2) Client calls:
   - `POST /v1/tenants/{tenant_id}/token/exchange`
   - `Authorization: Bearer <oidc_jwt>`
3) Control plane validates:
   - `iss` matches a tenant-allowed issuer
   - signature using JWKS (cached with TTL)
   - `exp/nbf` with clock skew
   - `aud` matches configured audiences
4) Control plane derives `principal_id` and loads RBAC policies/groupings for the tenant.
5) Effective permissions are computed from Casbin and expanded for inheritance.
6) Optional request filters reduce the permission set (`requested` / `resources`).
7) A Felix access token is minted, along with a refresh token, and both are returned.

If no permissions remain, the exchange returns `403`.

## Staying authenticated: refresh

The access token is deliberately short-lived (900s), because a leaked bearer
token is only as dangerous as the time it stays valid. That is the right trade
for a caller that can re-exchange freely and the wrong one for anything
long-running — a broker holding a 900s node token drops out of the cluster in
fifteen minutes. Raising the TTL trades the problem for a longer-lived secret.

Refresh is the answer instead. Exchange hands back a refresh token; presenting
it to `POST /v1/tenants/{tenant_id}/token/refresh` mints a new access token
with no upstream IdP round trip.

Three properties make that safe:

- **The secret is never stored.** The control plane keeps a SHA-256 of it, so a
  database read yields nothing presentable.
- **Every refresh token is single-use.** Refreshing spends the one presented and
  hands back its replacement. A stolen copy is worth one use, not a month of
  them.
- **A replay revokes the whole chain.** Nobody legitimately presents a spent
  token, so seeing one means two parties hold the chain. Both lose it, and the
  genuine holder re-exchanges. This is what makes single use *detect* theft
  rather than merely limit it.

Permissions are re-evaluated against current RBAC on every refresh, never
carried over from the previous token. A grant removed after a token was issued
stops working at the next refresh rather than whenever the caller happens to
re-exchange — a refresh that froze its grants would turn the short access TTL
into a long one for authorization purposes, which is most of what the short TTL
was for. If every grant is gone, the refresh is refused **and the chain ends**,
so a principal whose access was removed cannot keep rotating.

The group claims presented at exchange are recorded on the refresh token,
because group-derived grants cannot be recomputed without them. They are claims
to re-check, not permissions to reuse.

`FELIX_REFRESH_TOKEN_TTL_SECONDS` (default 30 days) bounds a refresh token that
is stolen and *never used* — one that is used produces a replay, which ends the
chain immediately.

To cut off a principal without waiting out any token's expiry, revoke its
refresh tokens for the tenant; every chain it holds ends at once.

## Bootstrap Mode (Day-0)

Felix includes a **one-time operator bootstrap** flow to initialize tenant auth before any admin tokens exist.

Why it exists:
- Admin endpoints require a Felix token with explicit management permissions.
- But Felix tokens require IdP issuer configuration and signing keys.
- Bootstrap fills that gap once per tenant, then is disabled.

### How it works

1) Operator enables bootstrap on the control plane:
   - `FELIX_BOOTSTRAP_ENABLED=true`
   - `FELIX_BOOTSTRAP_BIND_ADDR=127.0.0.1:9095` (or cluster-internal address)
   - `FELIX_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN=<random secret>`
   - optionally `FELIX_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN_PREVIOUS=<the token being rotated out>`,
     accepted alongside the current one so a rotation is a rolling deploy
     rather than an outage
   - optionally `FELIX_BOOTSTRAP_TLS_CERT` / `FELIX_BOOTSTRAP_TLS_KEY` /
     `FELIX_BOOTSTRAP_TLS_CLIENT_CA` (all three), which makes the bootstrap
     listener terminate mTLS and refuse, at the handshake, any client without
     a certificate signed by that CA
2) Operator calls the internal endpoint:
   - `POST /internal/bootstrap/tenants/{tenant_id}/initialize`
   - header `X-Felix-Bootstrap-Token: <token>`
3) Control plane:
   - creates the tenant if missing
   - generates signing keys (EdDSA / Ed25519)
   - seeds IdP issuers
   - seeds RBAC policies + groupings
   - marks the tenant as bootstrapped
   All of it commits as one atomic store operation, exactly once per tenant:
   racing the call against itself — including through different control-plane
   instances behind one load balancer — produces one winner and `409` for
   everyone else, and a failure part-way leaves the tenant retryable rather
   than half-initialized.
4) Operator disables bootstrap after use.

The threat model, token lifetime and replay rules, the rotation procedure, and
recovery steps are in [security/bootstrap.md](security/bootstrap.md).

### Example

```
POST /internal/bootstrap/tenants/t1/initialize
X-Felix-Bootstrap-Token: <secret>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "display_name": "Tenant One",
  "idp_issuers": [
    {
      "issuer": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant>/v2.0",
      "audiences": ["api://felix-controlplane"],
      "discovery_url": null,
      "jwks_url": null,
      "claim_mappings": {
        "subject_claim": "sub",
        "groups_claim": "groups"
      }
    }
  ],
  "initial_admin_principals": ["p:alice"]
}
```

### After bootstrap

Auth admin permissions:
- IdP issuer admin endpoints require `tenant.manage`.
- RBAC policy/grouping endpoints allow either:
  - `rbac.policy.manage` / `rbac.assignment.manage` at tenant scope (`tenant:{tenant_id}`), or
  - those same actions at narrower namespace/stream/cache scopes.
Bootstrap tokens **never** authorize normal admin endpoints.

## Broker Validation Flow

1) Client connects to a broker with `tenant_id` and a Felix token.
2) Broker verifies the token using tenant JWKS fetched from:
   - `GET /v1/tenants/{tenant_id}/.well-known/jwks.json`
3) Broker validates claims:
   - `iss = felix-auth`
   - `aud = felix-broker`
   - `exp/nbf`
   - `tid` matches connection tenant
4) Broker parses `perms` once at connect time and enforces per operation using keyMatch2.

## Data Stored Per Tenant

In the control plane store (memory or Postgres):
- Allowed OIDC issuers + audiences + claim mappings
- Casbin policies and groupings
- Tenant signing keys (current + previous for rotation)

## Allowing Particular Upstream IdPs

IdP trust is **configured per tenant**. The control plane only accepts tokens from issuers listed for that tenant, and only for configured audiences.

### Admin API (preferred)

IdP issuer endpoints require a Felix token with `tenant.manage` for the tenant.
RBAC endpoints require explicit RBAC actions (`rbac.view`, `rbac.policy.manage`, `rbac.assignment.manage`).

Use the control plane admin endpoints to manage IdP issuers per tenant:

```
POST /v1/tenants/{tenant_id}/idp-issuers
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "issuer": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant>/v2.0",
  "audiences": ["api://felix-controlplane"],
  "discovery_url": null,
  "jwks_url": null,
  "claim_mappings": {
    "subject_claim": "sub",
    "groups_claim": "groups"
  }
}
```

Delete an issuer:

```
DELETE /v1/tenants/{tenant_id}/idp-issuers/{issuer}
```

### Postgres (control plane store)

Insert or update the issuer in the `idp_issuers` table:

```sql
INSERT INTO idp_issuers (
  tenant_id,
  issuer,
  audiences,
  discovery_url,
  jwks_url,
  subject_claim,
  groups_claim
) VALUES (
  't1',
  'https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant>/v2.0',
  '["api://felix-controlplane"]'::jsonb,
  NULL,
  NULL,
  'sub',
  'groups'
)
ON CONFLICT (tenant_id, issuer) DO UPDATE SET
  audiences = EXCLUDED.audiences,
  discovery_url = EXCLUDED.discovery_url,
  jwks_url = EXCLUDED.jwks_url,
  subject_claim = EXCLUDED.subject_claim,
  groups_claim = EXCLUDED.groups_claim;
```

Notes:
- If `discovery_url` is `NULL`, the control plane uses `{iss}/.well-known/openid-configuration`.
- `jwks_url` can be set directly if your IdP doesn’t support discovery.
- `subject_claim` defaults to `sub`. `groups_claim` is optional.

### In-Memory Store (dev/tests)

Use the store API to add issuers during initialization:

```rust
store
  .upsert_idp_issuer(\"t1\", IdpIssuerConfig {
      issuer: \"https://example-idp\".to_string(),
      audiences: vec![\"felix-controlplane\".to_string()],
      discovery_url: None,
      jwks_url: Some(\"https://example-idp/.well-known/jwks.json\".to_string()),
      claim_mappings: ClaimMappings {
          subject_claim: \"sub\".to_string(),
          groups_claim: Some(\"groups\".to_string()),
      },
  })
  .await?;
```

The token exchange endpoint will reject upstream tokens if:
- the issuer is not listed for the tenant
- the audience does not match
- the signature or standard claims are invalid

## HTTP Endpoints

### Token Exchange

```
POST /v1/tenants/{tenant_id}/token/exchange
Authorization: Bearer <oidc_jwt>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "requested": ["stream.publish", "cache.read"],
  "resources": ["namespace:t1/payments", "stream:t1/payments/orders/*"]
}
```

Response:

```
{
  "felix_token": "<jwt>",
  "expires_in": 900,
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "refresh_token": "<token_id>.<secret>",
  "refresh_expires_in": 2592000
}
```

### Token Refresh

```
POST /v1/tenants/{tenant_id}/token/refresh
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "refresh_token": "<token_id>.<secret>"
}
```

No `Authorization` header: the refresh token *is* the credential.

Response:

```
{
  "felix_token": "<jwt>",
  "expires_in": 900,
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "refresh_token": "<new_token_id>.<new_secret>",
  "refresh_expires_in": 2592000
}
```

**Store the replacement before using the new access token.** The token you
presented is already spent; losing the replacement means re-exchanging.

Every failure answers `403` with the same message — unparseable, unknown,
expired, revoked, wrong secret. Distinguishing them would let a caller probe
which token ids exist.

A wrong secret against a real token id also spends the token. Someone holding
half a credential gets one guess, not unlimited ones.

### Tenant JWKS

```
GET /v1/tenants/{tenant_id}/.well-known/jwks.json
```

Response:

```
{
  "keys": [
    {
      "kty": "OKP",
      "kid": "k1",
      "alg": "EdDSA",
      "use": "sig",
      "crv": "Ed25519",
      "x": "..."
    }
  ]
}
```

## Example Policies

```text
# policy rules (p)
# p, <role>, <tenant>, <object>, <action>
p, role:tenant-admin, tenant-a, tenant:tenant-a, tenant.manage
p, role:tenant-admin, tenant-a, tenant:tenant-a, rbac.policy.manage
p, role:payments-admin, tenant-a, namespace:tenant-a/payments, ns.manage
p, role:publisher, tenant-a, stream:tenant-a/payments/*, stream.publish

# groupings (g)
# g, <user>, <role>, <tenant>
g, p:alice, role:tenant-admin, tenant-a
g, p:bob, role:payments-admin, tenant-a
```

## Error Semantics

- `401 Unauthorized`: invalid or missing upstream token
- `403 Forbidden`: tenant not allowed, issuer not allowed, or no permissions
- `500 Internal Server Error`: unexpected backend failures

## Future Work

- Add control plane API auth for administrative endpoints.
- mTLS and service-to-service auth for brokers and internal components.
- Policy editor and audit logging for auth decisions.
- More efficient permission compression for large policy sets.
