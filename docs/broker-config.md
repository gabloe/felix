# Broker Config Examples

This document shows sample `BrokerConfig` YAML files for common performance goals.

The broker attempts to load a YAML file from:
- `FELIX_BROKER_CONFIG` if set
- otherwise `/usr/local/felix/config.yml`

All fields are optional. Omitted values fall back to defaults. Every field also
has an environment variable override — see
[Environment Variables](../docs-site/docs/reference/environment-variables.md)
for the full `FELIX_*` mapping, including legacy aliases.

Defaults favor bounded latency and visible overload over unbounded buffering:
subscriber queues default to `drop_new` (shed and count, rather than block or
grow), and ingress sheds fire-and-forget publishes under sustained overload
unless `pub_ingress_wait` is enabled.

## General Purpose

Balanced settings for mixed workloads and moderate fanout — these are the
built-in defaults, shown explicitly.

```yaml

## Latency Optimized

Targets low tail latency for small payloads and limited batching. Matches the
`latency-demo` harness's latency profile (batch = 1): blocking queues so no
event is silently dropped, immediate flush, single writer per connection for
stable per-message ordering.

```yaml
ack_on_commit: true # NOTE: serializes commit/ack; reduces pipeline parallelism
publish_queue_wait_timeout_ms: 1000
ack_wait_timeout_ms: 1000
control_stream_drain_timeout_ms: 25
event_batch_max_events: 8
event_batch_max_delay_us: 100
fanout_batch_size: 8
pub_workers_per_conn: 2
pub_queue_depth: 32
subscriber_queue_capacity: 64
subscriber_queue_policy: block
subscriber_writer_lanes: 2
subscriber_lane_queue_depth: 32
subscriber_lane_queue_policy: block
max_subscriber_writer_lanes: 8
subscriber_lane_shard: auto
subscriber_single_writer_per_conn: true
subscriber_flush_max_items: 1
subscriber_flush_max_delay_us: 0
subscriber_max_bytes_per_write: 65536
```

## Throughput Optimized

Targets max lossless publish/delivery throughput with higher batching.
Matches the `latency-demo` harness's throughput profile (batch > 1):
blocking queues plus `pub_ingress_wait` so the publisher is paced to the
pipeline's sustainable rate instead of shedding — every message delivered,
`delivery drops 0`.

```yaml
ack_on_commit: false
publish_queue_wait_timeout_ms: 60000
ack_wait_timeout_ms: 3000
control_stream_drain_timeout_ms: 100
event_batch_max_events: 256
event_batch_max_bytes: 1048576
event_batch_max_delay_us: 2000
fanout_batch_size: 256
pub_workers_per_conn: 8
pub_queue_depth: 256
pub_inflight_bytes: 268435456
pub_ingress_wait: true
subscriber_queue_capacity: 4096
subscriber_queue_policy: block
subscriber_writer_lanes: 4
subscriber_lane_queue_depth: 1024
subscriber_lane_queue_policy: block
max_subscriber_writer_lanes: 8
subscriber_lane_shard: auto
subscriber_single_writer_per_conn: false
subscriber_flush_max_items: 16
subscriber_flush_max_delay_us: 50
subscriber_max_bytes_per_write: 65536
```

!!! note
    Lossless pacing (`block` queues + `pub_ingress_wait: true`) is a
    deliberate opt-in for pipelines that cannot tolerate drops, or for
    benchmarking sustainable throughput. Production defaults favor shedding
    (`drop_new`) so overload stays visible and bounded instead of building
    unbounded backlog under a slow subscriber. See
    [Benchmarks](../docs-site/docs/features/benchmarks.md#saturation-behavior).

## Multi-Core Scaling

`core_shards` runs each stream's publish worker and subscription lane feeders
on a dedicated, core-pinned (Linux) single-threaded runtime, selected
deterministically by stream handle id. This keeps a stream's fanout enqueue
and dequeue on one core instead of bouncing across tokio's work-stealing
pool. Off by default (`0`); benefits scale with stream count and are
neutral-to-positive for single-stream workloads.

```yaml
core_shards: 4 # e.g. physical cores - 2, leaving headroom for QUIC I/O
```

See [Benchmarks](../docs-site/docs/features/benchmarks.md) for measured
results.

## Client-Side Parallelism (Important)

Broker throughput and fanout scalability depend on client publish parallelism. For
high throughput or fanout workloads:

- Use multiple QUIC connections
- Use multiple publish streams per connection
- Use round-robin (RR) or hash-based sharding across streams

A single connection with a single publish stream will bottleneck regardless of broker tuning.

## Worker Sizing (Important)

> IMPORTANT: `pub_workers_per_conn` should not exceed the number of active publish streams.
> Excess workers increase contention and can worsen tail latency.

> When `core_shards > 0`, the shard count replaces `pub_workers_per_conn` as
> the publish worker count (one worker per shard, so each stream has a single
> owning core). `pub_workers_per_conn` is ignored in that mode.

## Notes

- All byte values are raw bytes; use powers of two for MiB values (e.g., 1048576 = 1 MiB).
- Tune `pub_workers_per_conn` and `pub_queue_depth` together; deep queues trade latency for throughput.
- Increasing `pub_workers_per_conn` only helps if publish load is spread across multiple streams or
  connections. Oversubscribing workers relative to streams can degrade performance.
- `pub_inflight_bytes` bounds actual queued-or-processing publish *bytes*, independent of
  `pub_queue_depth`'s item count — a handful of large batches can't blow past the ingress
  memory budget even with a small queue depth.
- `pub_conn_inflight_bytes` is a per-connection share of `pub_inflight_bytes`: it bounds how
  much of the shared budget a single connection can occupy, so one connection publishing large
  batches can't starve every other connection's admission. Must be smaller than
  `pub_inflight_bytes` to have any effect; a value equal to or larger than it degenerates to
  "no per-connection cap."
- `max_subscriptions_per_conn` bounds how many concurrent subscriptions a single QUIC connection
  may hold, independent of `subscriber_queue_capacity`. It protects broker memory from a
  connection that opens unbounded subscriptions rather than bounding any one subscription's
  buffer size.
- `subscriber_queue_capacity` and `subscriber_queue_policy` control broker-core per-subscriber
  buffering and drop behavior (the fanout enqueue path); `subscriber_lane_queue_depth` and
  `subscriber_lane_queue_policy` control the writer-lane stage one hop later (the actual QUIC
  write). Both default to `drop_new`.
- `subscriber_writer_lanes` and `subscriber_lane_shard` control outbound event write parallelism.
- `subscriber_lane_shard: auto` is the default and is usually the best starting point.
- Lanes often help high fanout + large payload workloads, but gains can plateau; do not assume
  that more than 8 lanes will improve performance.
- Event delivery uses binary `EventBatch` (or shared `EventBatch` — see
  [Wire Protocol](../docs-site/docs/architecture/wire-protocol.md)) frames. Unacknowledged
  client publishes are binary-encoded by default; acked publishes currently use the JSON
  control encoding (`Publisher::publish_json`/`publish_batch_json` select JSON explicitly).
- Queue depths directly impact memory usage. Large queue depths combined with large batch sizes and
  high fanout can significantly increase resident memory usage.
