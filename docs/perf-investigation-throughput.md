# Throughput investigation: why Felix is slower than raw QUIC

Working log of a performance investigation into Felix's end-to-end pub/sub
throughput, particularly at larger payload sizes. Records what was measured,
what was concluded, and — importantly — which hypotheses turned out to be
wrong.

**Status: resolved. Main ceiling fixed (rounds 7–10); the residual bimodality
was a path-MTU black-hole collapse (round 15); the Linux CI failure that
followed was publish-side shedding in an under-configured test, not a
transport defect (round 16).**
The ceiling was scheduling, not any Felix
stage: quinn's driver tasks do a bounded slice of work per poll and reschedule
themselves, so sustained throughput is that slice divided by scheduler re-poll
latency — and on a runtime shared with ~50 app tasks that latency, times one
wakeup chain per datagram, was the whole pipeline's clock. Fixes (all in Felix,
official quinn only): dedicated single-threaded I/O runtimes for quinn drivers,
colocation of the two transport-facing pump tasks with those drivers, and
QUIC ACK-frequency tuning. Result on the same box and benchmark:

| | Before | After |
|---|---:|---:|
| 4 KiB × batch 64, fanout 1 (sustained) | 73 MB/s | **p50 548 MB/s** (max 557) |
| 1 KiB, fanout 1 | 74.9 MB/s | **~480 MB/s** |
| 16 KiB, fanout 1 | ~72 MB/s | **~507 MB/s** |
| latency profile (1 KiB, batch 1, acked) | — | p50 129 µs / p999 256 µs |

**Both defects are fixed.** The residual bimodality (~30% of runs 5–6×
slower, rounds 12–14) turned out to be quinn's MTU black-hole detector
misreading a congestive loss burst and collapsing the path MTU to 1200 for
the rest of the run — see round 15 for the diagnosis and fix.

Map of this document: rounds 1–6 are the elimination history that pointed at the
mechanism; 7–10 are the diagnosis and fix of the main ceiling; 11–14 cover the
measurement-tooling defects found while publishing results, the endpoint
placement fix, and the characterization of the residual; 15 is the diagnosis
and fix of the residual.

## Environment

- Apple Mac Studio, Apple M4 Max, 16 CPUs
- macOS 26.6.1 (Darwin 25.6.0), APFS, loopback (`lo0`, MTU 16384)
- Release build, `latency-demo --binary`, `--all-features`
- Repo at `main` (a36c52c) plus the `--log-capacity` change below
- Relevant sysctls: `kern.ipc.maxsockbuf=8388608`,
  `net.inet.udp.recvspace=786896`, `net.inet.udp.maxdgram=9216`

Broker and client both run **in the same process** in this harness, sharing one
tokio runtime — worth remembering when reading CPU numbers.

## Headline findings

1. **The benchmark harness overstates throughput.** For most configurations the
   entire measured run fits inside the 64 MiB QUIC connection send window, so
   the reported number is buffer-absorption speed, not sustained throughput.
2. **There is no "large payload cliff."** Once every run exceeds the send
   window, 1 KiB and 4 KiB converge on the same ~73 MB/s payload rate. Larger
   payloads simply hit the window sooner, which *looked* size-dependent.
3. **Felix is meaningfully slower than raw quinn on the same box**, but the gap
   is ~3.5× on wire bytes at comparable core counts — not the 8× a naive
   payload-vs-payload comparison suggests. See "Corrections" below.
4. **Both Felix and raw quinn are ~90% system time** on macOS loopback. (An
   early suspicion that Felix sends smaller datagrams was later **disproven** —
   see round 2; Felix runs at MTU 16354 with ~15,650 B/datagram.)
5. **The ceiling is exactly per-byte** — 70–73 MB/s across a 16× payload range —
   and every structural explanation tested has been eliminated. See round 6.

## The measurement flaw (finding 1)

`felix-transport` defaults `send_window` to 64 MiB
(`crates/felix-transport/src/lib.rs:52`). Any run whose total payload volume is
below that is absorbed by buffers before backpressure appears, and
`latency-demo` stops its clock when the last event arrives.

Throughput at 4 KiB, fanout 1, batch 64, varying run length (3 reps each):

| `--total` | Run bytes | Reps (msg/s) |
|---|---:|---|
| 8,000 | 31 MB (fits) | 70,085 / 75,993 / 79,078 |
| 20,000 | 78 MB (exceeds) | 29,679 / 28,173 / 30,090 |
| 40,000 | 156 MB (exceeds) | 19,979 / 22,112 / 20,559 |

Variance within a run length is ~±5%; across run lengths throughput falls
monotonically. The marginal rate between successive windows keeps dropping
(20,800 → 16,370 msg/s), so this is not a fixed startup transient — the short
runs are simply measuring buffer fill.

**Consequence:** the numbers in
`docs-site/src/content/docs/features/benchmarks.md` are affected. The macOS
1 KiB × fanout 1 row (244–263 K msg/s) is a buffer-absorption measurement. That
page's methodology section promises "sustainable rates, not burst rates measured
while shedding" — it is correct about shedding (drops really are 0), but the
buffering artifact defeats the intent regardless.

## The cliff is an artifact (finding 2)

Original payload sweep (fanout 1, batch 64, total 20,000 — all under the window
except the last two rows):

| Payload | msg/s | MB/s |
|---|---:|---:|
| 1024 B | 332,042 | 340.0 |
| 1500 B | 276,571 | 414.9 |
| 2048 B | 181,321 | 371.3 |
| 2560 B | 82,898 | 212.2 |
| 3072 B | 57,273 | 175.9 |
| 4096 B | 32,822 | 134.4 |
| 8192 B | 16,469 | 134.9 |

Re-run with every configuration sized to exceed 64 MiB:

| Payload | Total | Run bytes | msg/s | MB/s |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 256 B | 400,000 | 98 MB | 975,550 | 249.7 |
| 1 KiB | 200,000 | 195 MB | 73,126 | **74.9** |
| 4 KiB | 60,000 | 234 MB | 17,692 | **72.5** |

1 KiB collapses from 358 MB/s to 74.9 MB/s (4.8×) and lands on top of 4 KiB.
The 256 B run was only 1.5× the window, so 249.7 MB/s is likely still partly
inflated.

Supporting evidence that the effect tracks *bytes*, not frame size (total
40,000):

| Config | Frame size | msg/s |
|---|---:|---:|
| 4 KiB × batch 4 | 16 KiB | 53,586 |
| 4 KiB × batch 16 | 64 KiB | 20,128 |
| 4 KiB × batch 64 | 256 KiB | 20,419 |
| 1 KiB × batch 256 | 256 KiB | 367,415 |

Identical 256 KiB frames give 20 K or 367 K msg/s depending only on payload
size, i.e. on total run bytes relative to the window.

## Raw quinn baseline (finding 3)

Standalone probe replicating Felix's transport settings exactly — same windows,
same MTU config, same 8 MiB `SO_SNDBUF`/`SO_RCVBUF` halve-until-accepted loop —
moving bytes over loopback with no broker, no wire protocol, no fanout.
One uni stream, 256 KiB writes, 32 MB per run.

| MTU upper bound | MTU reached | MB/s | Lost | Cong. events | Black holes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1452 | 1452 | 144.4 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 2048 | 1942 | 187.2 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 4096 | 3915 | 415.7 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **8192** | 7973 | **819.0** | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 9216 | 8715 | 748.6 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 16384 (Felix default) | 16324 | 628.7 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

Second run under `/usr/bin/time` reproduced the shape (1452→149.9, 2048→186.4,
4096→381.3, 8192→725.9, 9216→742.9, 16384→506.8 MB/s).

Two things fall out:

- **Socket buffers are load-bearing.** An earlier version of the probe without
  the 8 MiB buffers **failed outright** at upper bounds ≥9216 (connection timed
  out), and at 1452 reported `lost=75, cong_events=46, black_holes=2` with MTU
  stuck at 1200. Felix sets these buffers correctly; this is a latent trap for
  anything that does not.
- **16384 is not the best upper bound even for raw quinn.** 8192 is ~30% faster
  (819 vs 629 MB/s). Larger datagrams stop paying once per-datagram cost is
  amortised.

Felix's own MTU sweep (4 KiB, total 60,000) is nearly flat by comparison, which
is itself the signal that Felix never gets close to the transport ceiling:

| Setting | msg/s | MB/s | Datagrams | Avg B/datagram |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| baseline (upper 16384, init 1200) | 18,484 | 75.7 | 267,790 | 1,835 |
| upper 9216 | 16,376 | 67.1 | 294,742 | 1,668 |
| init 8192, upper 9216 | 16,687 | 68.3 | 291,198 | 1,688 |
| upper 1452 | 8,858 | 36.3 | 558,153 | 881 |
| upper 16384 (repeat) | 17,997 | 73.7 | 267,402 | 1,838 |

Note the average-bytes-per-datagram column is diluted by ACKs in both directions
and by loopback double-counting; treat it as indicative, not exact.

## CPU profile (finding 4)

`/usr/bin/time -l`, 80,000 × 4 KiB, fanout 1, batch 64:

| | Felix | Raw probe (6 runs) |
|---|---:|---:|
| real | 5.02 s | 1.03 s |
| user | 1.63 s | 0.27 s |
| **sys** | **15.60 s** | **2.64 s** |
| sys:user ratio | 9.6:1 | 9.8:1 |
| Cores busy (CPU/wall) | 3.4 of 16 | 2.8 |
| Voluntary ctx switches | 7,374 | 0 |
| Involuntary ctx switches | 361,126 | 54,279 |
| Max RSS | 554 MB | — |

Both are overwhelmingly kernel time — macOS UDP loopback is syscall-dominated,
consistent with what `benchmarks.md` already reports. Critically, **Felix leaves
12+ of 16 cores idle** while running well below the transport ceiling, so this
is not a CPU-saturation problem.

`sample`-based symbol occurrence counts over 8 s under load (occurrence counts
of frames in the call tree, **not** sample-weighted — indicative only):

```
__sendmsg 63   __psynch_mutexwait 41   __psynch_cvsignal 32   malloc 29
kevent 26      platform_memmove 24     __recvmsg 23           __psynch_cvwait 21
free 10        __psynch_mutexdrop 8
ring aes_gcm seal 19   rustls encrypt_in_place 15   aes_gcm_enc_kernel 14
```

The pthread mutex/condvar family taken together is the largest userspace
category, which lines up with the note already in `benchmarks.md` that the next
target is "user-space scheduling and synchronization."

## Corrections — hypotheses that were tested and disproven

Recorded deliberately, because several are plausible enough to be re-proposed.

1. **The redundant payload copy is not the bottleneck.** `decode_publish_batch`
   does `bytes.to_vec()` per payload (`crates/felix-wire/src/binary.rs:250`) and
   every caller immediately converts back with `Bytes::from(vec)`
   (`handlers/publish/uni.rs:82`, `control.rs:108`) — a genuine
   `Bytes`→`Vec`→`Bytes` round trip caused only by `PublishBatch.payloads` being
   `Vec<Vec<u8>>`. Measured: **6.8 µs per 64 × 4 KiB frame (38.3 GB/s)** versus
   0.2 µs for a refcount clone. At 73 MB/s that is ~0.2% of one core. Worth
   fixing for cleanliness; irrelevant to throughput.
2. **The read scratch buffer does not realloc per frame.** The
   `clear()`/`resize()`/`split().freeze()` pattern in
   `transport/quic/codec.rs` looked like it would allocate every frame.
   Measured: **1 allocation across 10,000 frames** at 4 KiB, 64 KiB and 256 KiB.
   It reuses correctly.
3. **Replay-ring retention is not the cause.** `latency_demo.rs:679` sizes the
   ring to the whole run (`warmup + total + 1`) instead of the production
   default of 1024 (`crates/felix-broker/src/config.rs:4`), and RSS climbs
   13 → 410 MB during a run without plateauing. A/B against a 1024-entry ring:
   **0.92× / 1.01× / 1.02×** at totals 8,000 / 20,000 / 40,000. Not causal.
4. **`net.inet.udp.maxdgram` does not cap this path.** It is 9216, below Felix's
   16384 discovery bound, which looked like a smoking gun. The raw probe reached
   **MTU 16324** with zero loss, so the cap does not apply here.
5. **Publish-worker serialization is not the bottleneck.** All streams in the
   default benchmark hash to one worker per connection
   (`handle.id() % worker_count`, `handlers/publish/ingress.rs`). Adding streams
   makes throughput *worse*, not better: `pub_stream_count` 1 / 4 / 8 →
   17,418 / 15,190 / 14,469 msg/s. More parallelism costs more than it buys.
6. **`core_shards` does not help this workload.** Measured at a valid run size
   (4 KiB, total 60,000, 2 reps): shards 0 → ~71.4 MB/s, 4 → ~75.2, 6 → ~75.3.
   About +5%, near noise. The existing +25–27% claims in the docs were likely
   measured under the buffer-absorption artifact and should be re-run.
7. **The "8× slower than raw quinn" framing was overstated.** That compared
   Felix's *payload* throughput (73 MB/s) against the probe's *best-config*
   one-directional throughput. At fanout 1 Felix moves ~146 MB/s of wire traffic
   (publish in + delivery out), against the probe's 506–628 MB/s at the same MTU
   setting and a similar core count. **The honest gap is ~3.5× on wire bytes.**

## Current best understanding

The publisher blocks in `client_send_await` (p50 3.8 ms at 4 KiB) while every
instrumented broker operation stays in the microseconds — `broker_decode` 27 µs,
`broker_publish_append` 1 µs, `broker_quic_write` 2 µs, `broker_sub_write` 2 µs.
The machine is 90% kernel time and 12+ cores idle. So the cost is not in any
single operation and not in CPU-bound work; it is in how many kernel operations
Felix performs per byte, and in the handoffs between the tasks that perform them.

The leading suspicion — **not yet verified** — is that Felix's effective
datagram size is far below the MTU quinn negotiates. The probe sent ~15,267
bytes per packet (2,096 packets for 32 MB at upper 16384); Felix's netstat-derived
average is ~1,835 bytes. If real, that is ~8× more syscalls per byte and would
directly explain a 90%-sys workload running 3.5× slow. Possible reasons, all
unexamined: small writes reaching the socket before coalescing, per-frame
`write_all` splitting header from payload (`transport/quic/codec.rs` issues two
`write_all` calls), ACK-heavy traffic from many concurrent streams, or MTU
discovery not completing within a short run.

## Round 2: the transport is healthy, and the cost is synchronization

Added `FELIX_CONN_STATS_MS` to the broker (`transport/quic/conn.rs`) to log
`quinn::ConnectionStats` for a *live* connection, and tracing init to the demo so
it surfaces. Felix's busiest connection under load:

```
mtu=16354  sent_packets=15108  lost_packets=0  congestion_events=0  black_holes=0
udp_tx_datagrams=15106  udp_tx_bytes=236417567  udp_tx_ios=15106
```

**15,650 bytes per datagram, zero loss, zero congestion events.** Path MTU
discovery works perfectly. The netstat-derived "~1,835 B/datagram" from round 1
was wrong — it is diluted by ACKs, idle connections and system-wide traffic.
`udp_tx_ios == udp_tx_datagrams` confirms no GSO on macOS, one syscall per
datagram, as expected.

### The raw-quinn baseline, corrected twice

Round 1's "628–819 MB/s" figures were **32 MB runs — inside the 64 MiB send
window**, so the probe had the same measurement flaw as the harness. Sweeping
run size properly:

| Run | MB/s | MTU | B/datagram | Lost |
|---|---:|---|---:|---:|
| 16 MB | 12279.0 | 16354 | 16186 | 0 | ← buffer-absorbed, meaningless |
| 32 MB | 573.6 | 16354 | 16237 | 0 | ← buffer-absorbed |
| 64 MB | 638.6 | 16324 | 16189 | 0 | ← buffer-absorbed |
| 128 MB | 745.8 | 16354 | 16278 | 0 | |
| 256 MB | 752.2 | 16354 | 16331 | 0 | |
| 512 MB | 788.0 | 16354 | 16340 | 0 | |

**Raw quinn sustains ~750–800 MB/s.** One intermediate run reported 80.3 MB/s
with MTU collapsed to 1200 and 649 lost packets; it has not reproduced across
six subsequent runs and is treated as an anomaly, but it shows MTU discovery
*can* come undone under sustained single-stream load.

### Nothing in the pipeline is saturated

Queue sweep at a valid run size (234 MB) — all flat:

| Config | MB/s |
|---|---:|
| baseline | 72.4 |
| `SUB_QUEUE_CAPACITY=4096` (broker core queue) | 73.3 |
| `SUB_QUEUE_BOUND=1024` (writer lane queue) | 72.3 |
| both raised | 73.7 |
| `PUBLISH_INFLIGHT_BYTES=32MiB` | 71.6 |
| all three | 77.5 |

Note this also retracts round 1's "+34% from `PUBLISH_INFLIGHT_BYTES`" — that was
measured on a buffer-absorbed run. At a valid size it does nothing.

Instrumentation overhead is likewise minor: timings on 17,430 / timings off
18,293 / non-telemetry build 17,577 msg/s.

Per-thread CPU during a fanout-1 run (`ps -M`): **no thread is saturated.**
Eight threads sit at 37–49%, and every busy thread shows roughly **11:1 system
to user time** (e.g. 1.52 s STIME against 0.14 s UTIME).

### The ceiling is per-byte, and it is kernel time that is not I/O

| | Felix | Raw quinn |
|---|---:|---:|
| Throughput | 73 MB/s payload (~146 MB/s wire) | 798 MB/s |
| user | 1.63 s | 0.30 s |
| sys | 15.60 s | 1.50 s |
| **sys per MB** | **23.8 ms** | **2.93 ms** |
| Cores busy | 3.4 of 16 | 1.7 |
| Involuntary ctx switches | 361,126 | 32,837 |

**Felix spends ~8× more kernel time per byte than raw quinn** — and the weighted
self-time profile shows `__sendmsg` is only 2.3% of samples. So that kernel time
is not I/O. It is thread scheduling, futex and condvar traffic.

Corrected self-time profile (the round-1 "symbol occurrence counts" were
meaningless — they ignored both sample weights and tree structure):

```
 5.2%  tracing Instrumented::poll
 4.5%  tokio blocking task poll
 2.9%  quinn_proto Connection::poll_transmit
 2.6%  clock_gettime_nsec_np      \
 2.4%  std Timespec::now           |  ~9.8% total in clock reads
 2.4%  clock_gettime               |
 2.4%  mach_absolute_time         /
 2.4%  __psynch_mutexwait          \
 2.4%  pthread_mutex_firstfit_lock_slow  |  ~10% in lock/condvar
 2.4%  pthread_mutex_firstfit_lock_wait  |
 1.6%  __psynch_cvsignal / pthread_cond_signal  /
 2.3%  __sendmsg
 2.1%  _platform_memmove
 1.7%  broker::transport::quic::codec::read_frame_limited_into
```

### Delivery scales with fanout; a single subscriber does not

| Fanout | Delivered | Publish side |
|---|---:|---:|
| 1 | 74.8 MB/s | 74.8 MB/s |
| 2 | 127.3 MB/s | 63.6 MB/s |
| 4 | 213.3 MB/s | 53.3 MB/s |
| 8 | 294.4 MB/s | 36.8 MB/s |

Aggregate capacity is not capped at 73 MB/s — it reaches 294 MB/s across eight
independent subscriber chains. **One subscriber's chain caps at ~75 MB/s**,
against raw quinn's 750 MB/s on a single stream.

## Diagnosis

Every fact now points one way. The transport is healthy (full MTU, zero loss,
zero congestion). No thread, queue, lock or buffer is saturated. The ceiling is
per-byte rather than per-message or per-frame (1 KiB and 4 KiB both land at
~73 MB/s despite a 4× difference in message *and* frame rate). Kernel time per
byte is ~8× raw quinn's while actual I/O syscalls are ~2% of the profile. Adding
independent chains (fanout) scales; adding parallelism within a chain
(`pub_stream_count`, `core_shards`, deeper queues) does not.

That is a **latency-bound dependency chain, not a throughput-bound resource**:
each stage blocks handing off to the next, and the cost is a kernel round trip
per handoff. The reason it presents as a *byte* rate is that wakeups scale with
**datagram count** — `read_exact` on a 256 KiB frame is woken once per ~16 KB
datagram arrival — and datagram count is bytes divided by MTU. This also explains
the MTU sensitivity measured in round 1 (upper 1452 → 36.3 MB/s vs upper 16384 →
75.7 MB/s): fewer, larger datagrams mean proportionally fewer wakeups.

**Unverified.** The wakeup-per-datagram mechanism is inferred from converging
evidence, not directly counted. Counting wakeups per byte — via the existing
`felix_perf_publish_worker_wakeups_total` / `..._jobs_total` counters under the
`perf_debug` feature, or `dtrace` on context switches — is the step that would
confirm or kill it, and should happen before any large change.

## Round 3: the architecture is not the problem

The one-hop blast is an unfair target — Felix does two QUIC hops and twice the
wire traffic by construction. So: a minimal **store-and-forward relay**
(publisher → relay → subscriber), where the relay parses length-prefixed frames
and forwards each one. This is the smallest thing that does the broker's job,
and it establishes what Felix's *architecture* is worth on this box.

512 MB per run, past the send window:

| Relay read strategy | Frame | Delivered |
|---|---:|---:|
| `read_exact` (what Felix does) | 256 KiB | **541.2 MB/s** |
| `read_chunk` (zero-copy) | 256 KiB | 523.8 MB/s |
| `read_exact` | 64 KiB | 532.1 MB/s |
| `read_chunk` | 64 KiB | 541.5 MB/s |

Two conclusions, one of which kills the leading candidate fix:

1. **Store-and-forward over two QUIC hops is worth ~540 MB/s.** Felix gets
   73 MB/s — **13% of what its own architecture allows.** The gap is Felix's
   code, not QUIC, not the extra hop, not macOS loopback.
2. **`read_exact` vs `read_chunk` makes no measurable difference.** Candidate fix
   #1 below is dead. Good: it was the most invasive of the three and would have
   been implemented on a hunch.

CPU per byte, all three systems, normalised to wire bytes:

| | sys per MB wire | user | Throughput |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Raw quinn, one hop | 2.93 ms | 0.30 s | 798 MB/s |
| Minimal relay, two hops | 2.5 ms | 2.70 s | 541 MB/s |
| **Felix** | **23.8 ms** | 1.63 s | 73 MB/s |

Felix's **user** time is unremarkable — lower than the relay's, in fact. Its
**system** time per byte is ~9× the relay's. Since datagram sizes and counts are
comparable and `__sendmsg` is ~2% of the profile, that kernel time is
synchronization: futex/condvar traffic from task and thread handoffs. Felix runs
~19 threads with many hops per batch; the relay runs three tasks.

## Round 4: runtime width matters; frame granularity does not; the pipeline is bimodal

### Tokio worker threads is the only reproducible lever found

Added `FELIX_WORKER_THREADS` to the demo (it previously took tokio's default of
one worker per CPU). 4 KiB, fanout 1, batch 64, 234 MB run:

| Worker threads | MB/s |
|---|---:|
| 1 | 69.0 |
| **2** | **98.5** |
| 3 | 90.2 |
| 4 | 76.3 |
| 6 | 78.2 |
| 8 | 78.4 |
| 16 (default) | 74.2 |

**+33% from reducing parallelism.** A serial dependency chain cannot use extra
cores; spreading its stages across them only adds cross-core wakeups. Caveat:
this harness runs broker and clients in one process, so the ideal width here is
not necessarily the ideal width for a standalone broker.

### The 64 KiB egress granularity is real but is not the cost

Static analysis (correctly) identified that `event_batch_max_bytes` defaults to
64 KiB (`crates/felix-broker/src/config.rs:115`), that
`handlers/subscribe/feeder.rs` splits a 256 KiB envelope into four separately
encoded 64 KiB lane frames, and that `_lane_flush_hints` in `feeder.rs:24-29` is
a dead binding — `flush_max_items`, `flush_max_delay` and `max_bytes_per_write`
are captured and never used. **All three verified in the code.**

The prediction was that letting a batch travel as one frame would cut downstream
scheduling ~4×. Measured (2 reps each):

| Config | MB/s |
|---|---:|
| baseline (four 64 KiB frames per batch) | 74.8 / 74.0 |
| `EVENT_BATCH_MAX_BYTES=1MiB` | 72.6 / 73.6 |
| `SUB_MAX_BYTES_PER_WRITE=1MiB` | 73.4 / 77.7 |
| both = 1 MiB (one frame per batch) | 75.9 / 76.5 |
| both + `WORKER_THREADS=2` | 92.2 / 88.1 |

**No effect.** Only the thread-count lever survives. This is consistent with the
round-3 relay result: hops, locks and copies are individually free, so reducing
the number of them does not help either. The chain description is accurate; the
causal claim attached to it is not.

`_lane_flush_hints` being dead is still a real bug worth fixing — the configured
flush delay genuinely does nothing — but fixing it will not recover throughput.

### The pipeline is bimodal — the strongest remaining lead

Back-to-back runs of an *identical* configuration
(`WORKER_THREADS=2`, `DISABLE_TIMINGS=1`, `--sub-delivery-shaping-off`):

```
repeat 1:  97,475 msg/s  (399 MB/s)
repeat 2:  23,649 msg/s   (97 MB/s)
```

and separately `threads=2 + shaping off` alone hit 95,627 msg/s (392 MB/s),
while `shaping off` by itself on default threads gives 17,224 (71 MB/s).

**Felix intermittently runs 4× faster on identical settings.** Delivery drops
stay 0 in both modes, so the fast mode is not shedding. This is the single most
informative unexplained observation: the pipeline can evidently reach ~400 MB/s
— within striking distance of the 540 MB/s relay ceiling — but usually settles
into a mode that is 4× slower.

That is the signature of a scheduling/coalescing bistability: in one mode a
stage accumulates several items per wakeup and amortises the chain; in the other
it processes one item per wakeup in lockstep. Which one it lands in appears to
depend on startup timing. **Finding what selects the fast mode, and making it
the only mode, is the most promising path to closing the gap** — far more so
than any of the structural changes tested so far.

## Round 5: the direct subscription writer — built, correct, no faster

Implemented the direct egress path: one task owning both the subscription
receiver and the QUIC `SendStream`, draining, encoding, coalescing up to
`max_bytes_per_write`, and issuing a single `write_all_chunks`. It skips lane
registration entirely — no lane channel, no lane task, no connection-writer
channel or task, no DashMap routing, no `FuturesUnordered`. Behind
`subscriber_direct_writer` / `FELIX_SUB_DIRECT_WRITER` so it can be A/B'd.

4 KiB, fanout 1, batch 64, 234 MB run, 3 reps:

| Path | msg/s |
|---|---|
| lane path (default) | 17,712 / 18,777 / 18,578 |
| **direct writer** | 18,086 / 18,845 / 17,682 |
| direct writer + `WORKER_THREADS=2` | 23,106 / 21,169 / 21,460 |

**No difference.** Correctness is clean: `delivery drops 0`, received equals
published, and fanout 4 still delivers correctly (67,930 msg/s). Only the
thread-count lever moves anything, exactly as it did on the lane path.

This is the fifth structural hypothesis to fail, and the round-3 relay probe
predicted it: if 4 added mpsc hops plus a mutex and a copy cost nothing, then
removing 2 hops cannot recover anything either.

### Why the remaining plan items are also unlikely

- **Making batching real / raising write sizes.** Round 4 already tested the
  prediction directly: one frame per batch instead of four measured the same.
- **Batching client dispatch (one channel op per frame instead of 64).** The
  ceiling is invariant to event rate — 1 KiB delivers 73,126 events/s and 4 KiB
  delivers 18,250 events/s, both at ~73 MB/s. A per-event cost would cap
  events/s, not bytes/s. Ruled out by that invariance.
- **Removing the client publisher round trip.** Same argument: it is per-batch,
  and batch rate varies 4× across payload sizes with no change in byte rate.
- **Flow control.** Checked: the client's event stream window is already 64 MiB
  and its connection window 256 MiB (`crates/felix-client/src/config.rs:27-29`).
  At 73 MB/s that is 0.86 s of buffering — not window-limited.

## Where this leaves it

Established beyond reasonable doubt:

- The limit is **per-byte**, invariant to event rate, frame rate, frame size, and
  egress topology.
- It is **not** the transport (MTU 16354, zero loss, zero congestion events),
  not CPU (12 of 16 cores idle, user time lower than the relay's), not any
  queue, lock, copy, or channel hop, and not the number of tasks in the chain.
- Felix burns **~9× the system time per byte** of an equivalent relay while
  doing ~2% of its profile in `sendmsg`.
- A functionally equivalent two-hop relay reaches **540 MB/s**; Felix reaches 73.

The one observation that has not been explained, and the only one that shows the
gap is closable without redesign, is the **bimodality**: identical configurations
have produced 97,475 and 23,649 msg/s on back-to-back runs, and ~400 MB/s has
been observed more than once. Something selects between a coalescing mode and a
lockstep mode at startup.

**Next step should be instrumentation, not another refactor.** Specifically, a
per-wakeup item-count histogram at each stage that survives into the fast/slow
runs, so the mode difference can be attributed. Five topology changes have now
been tested against this ceiling and none moved it; a sixth without a mechanism
in hand is not a good bet.

## Round 6: nothing is backpressured, and the byte ceiling is exact

### QUIC flow control is never the constraint

Extended `FELIX_CONN_STATS_MS` to log `frame_tx`/`frame_rx` `data_blocked` and
`stream_data_blocked` counters. These are the definitive test: an endpoint emits
`DATA_BLOCKED` / `STREAM_DATA_BLOCKED` precisely when it has bytes to send and
the peer has denied it credit.

Sampled across a full run, including the connection that pushed 213 MB:

```
tx=121MB mtu=16354 tx_data_blocked=0 tx_stream_data_blocked=0 rx_data_blocked=0 rx_stream_data_blocked=0
tx=213MB mtu=16354 tx_data_blocked=0 tx_stream_data_blocked=0 rx_data_blocked=0 rx_stream_data_blocked=0
```

**Zero, in both directions, on every connection.** Combined with zero lost
packets and zero congestion events, *nothing in the QUIC layer is ever
backpressured*. The broker is not credit-starved by a slow client, and the
publisher is not credit-starved by the broker.

This inverts the reading of `client_send_await p50 = 3.8 ms`. It is not evidence
of something blocking downstream — if it were, we would see blocked frames. The
producer side simply is not feeding faster.

### Publisher concurrency does not scale

| `--pub-conns` (×2 streams) | MB/s |
|---|---:|
| 1 | 78.3 |
| 2 | 75.0 |
| 4 (default) | 74.0 |
| 8 | 73.2 |
| 16 | 73.8 |

**One publisher connection reaches the same rate as sixteen.** This rules out the
client publisher's `mpsc send → oneshot wait` round trip and the benchmark's
sequential batch awaiting: both are per-batch costs that more concurrency would
amortise.

### The byte ceiling is exact across a 16× payload range

Every row ~312 MB, so all are past the send window:

| Payload | Total | msg/s | MB/s |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 2 KiB | 160,000 | 35,707 | **73.1** |
| 4 KiB | 80,000 | 17,128 | **70.2** |
| 8 KiB | 40,000 | 8,675 | **71.1** |
| 16 KiB | 20,000 | 4,382 | **71.8** |
| 32 KiB | 10,000 | 2,185 | **71.6** |

**A 16× spread in payload size and a 16× spread in message rate produce the same
70–73 MB/s.** This is the strongest single result in the investigation. It
definitively eliminates every per-message, per-event, per-batch and per-frame
explanation — including client dispatch channel operations, publisher round
trips, encode/decode cost, and framing overhead. Any of those would hold
*messages* per second constant, not *bytes*.

## Summary of what has been eliminated

Measured and disproven, each with data above:

| Hypothesis | Verdict |
|---|---|
| Transport / QUIC / MTU / loss | MTU 16354, 0 lost, 0 congestion events |
| QUIC flow control | 0 blocked frames, both directions |
| CPU saturation | 12 of 16 cores idle; user time below the relay's |
| `Bytes`→`Vec`→`Bytes` copy | 0.2% of a core |
| Read strategy (`read_exact` vs `read_chunk`) | no difference in relay probe |
| Replay-ring retention | A/B 0.92×–1.02× |
| Channel hops / locks / re-encode copies | relay with 4 hops + mutex + copy: no change |
| Egress topology (lane → direct writer) | no change, 3 reps each |
| Egress frame granularity (64 KiB → 1 MiB) | no change |
| Queue depths (core, lane, inflight bytes) | flat 71.6–77.5 MB/s |
| Publish worker sharding / `pub_stream_count` | more is worse |
| Publisher connection concurrency | flat 1 → 16 |
| `core_shards` | +5%, near noise |
| Per-event/per-batch client costs | byte rate invariant over 16× message rate |
| Instrumentation overhead | ~5% |

The only lever that moves anything is **tokio worker thread count** (+20–33% at
2 threads), and the only unexplained observation is the **bimodality** (identical
config producing 97,475 and 23,649 msg/s; ~400 MB/s seen more than once).

## What the evidence now points to

A ceiling that is:

- exactly proportional to bytes, across 16× payload and message-rate ranges,
- invariant to every topology, queue, concurrency and batching change tested,
- not flow-control, congestion, loss, or CPU bound,
- ~9× more kernel time per byte than an equivalent relay, with ~2% of the
  profile in `sendmsg`,
- and occasionally, on identical settings, 4–5× higher,

is characteristic of a **time-quantised stage**: something that moves a bounded
amount of data per scheduling interval, so the rate is (bytes per cycle) /
(cycle time) regardless of how those bytes are packaged. That would explain the
byte-exactness, the immunity to topology, the idle cores, the kernel-heavy
system time, and the bimodality (two stable cycle patterns).

Concrete suspects not yet eliminated, in order:

1. A timer- or park-driven wakeup cycle in the delivery path — note
   `71 MB/s ÷ 64 KiB ≈ 1,090 writes/s ≈ 0.92 ms per write`, suspiciously close to
   a 1 ms timer granularity. Raising `max_bytes_per_write` alone did not move it,
   which would fit if the *actual* per-cycle payload is bounded elsewhere.
2. Tokio timer/park interaction on this runtime (`Driver::park_internal` appeared
   in the profile).
3. Something in the client receive loop that parks per cycle rather than
   draining what is available.

The decisive next measurement is a **timestamped trace of one subscriber's write
cycle** — when each write is issued, how many bytes it carried, and how long the
task was parked between writes. That directly reads off "bytes per cycle" and
"cycle time" and would confirm or kill the quantisation theory in one run. The
`felix_sub_direct_write_frames` / `felix_sub_direct_write_bytes` histograms added
with the direct writer are the natural place to start.

## Candidate fixes, highest confidence first

1. ~~**Read with `read_chunk` instead of `read_exact`.**~~ **Disproven (round 3)**
   — the relay probe shows no difference. Do not do this.
2. ~~**Reduce egress frame granularity.**~~ **Disproven (round 4)** — one frame
   per batch instead of four measures the same.
3. ~~**Collapse handoffs in the delivery chain.**~~ **Disproven (round 3)** — a
   relay with 4 added mpsc hops, a mutex ring append and a re-encode copy runs
   at 507–534 MB/s, indistinguishable from the 511 MB/s zero-hop baseline. Hops
   are not the cost, so removing them will not help.
4. **Investigate the bimodality.** *(now the top item — items 1-3 and the direct
   writer are all disproven)* The pipeline reaches ~400 MB/s intermittently
   on unchanged settings. Instrument which stage's batching collapses in the slow
   mode — a per-wakeup item-count histogram at each stage
   (`feeder`, `run_writer_lane`, `run_connection_writer`, client dispatch) would
   show it directly. This is the highest-value next step.
5. **Set runtime width deliberately.** Worth ~20–33% and already measurable, but
   validate against a standalone broker before changing any default.
6. **Fix `_lane_flush_hints`** (`feeder.rs:24-29`) — the configured flush delay
   is silently ignored. A correctness/config-honesty bug, not a throughput fix,
   though it may interact with the bimodality above since coalescing is exactly
   what the dead hints were meant to control.

Not worth doing on this evidence: the `Bytes`→`Vec`→`Bytes` copy, storage/fsync
work, `io_uring`, anything sendfile-shaped, or `core_shards` as a default.

## Round 7: cwnd/rtt visibility kills the congestion theories — and relocates the problem

Added `cwnd`/`rtt` to the broker's `FELIX_CONN_STATS_MS` logging and a matching
client-side logger (the client is the sender on the publish path, so its
congestion state is invisible from broker-side stats).

- **Congestion window is not the cap.** The busy delivery connection grows to
  cwnd 22–30 MB; the busy publish connection to 13–15 MB. Idle/app-limited
  connections pin at the 2×MTU minimum (32,708 B), but they carry no load.
- **Loopback RTT under load is 30–100 ms** — pure queuing delay (~3–8 MB
  standing in kernel socket buffers). The transport is being fed and drained
  slower than it can go, and the queue keeps the control loop sluggish.
- `FELIX_INITIAL_CWND=8MiB` on every endpoint: no change. Confirms cwnd is not
  binding.
- **The "backpressured pipeline" framing was wrong for this harness.** The demo
  sets `subscriber_queue_capacity = 4096`, but that counts *envelopes*: at
  batch 64 × 4 KiB each envelope is 256 KiB, so the queue absorbs ~1 GiB. In a
  slow run the publish side finished the whole 1.2 GB run in ~2.5 s
  (~550 MB/s!) while delivery crawled for another 15 s. **Publish ingest was
  never the bottleneck; the broker→subscriber delivery chain is the bimodal
  stage.**
- In slow mode the delivery connection sends a steady 80 MB/s with zero loss,
  zero blocked frames and a 22 MB cwnd — the transport is idle; the app side
  offers one ~52 KB write per ~0.8 ms. In fast mode the same code pushes
  450–500 MB/s (with some socket-buffer loss, which Cubic absorbs).

## Round 8: the mechanism — driver re-poll latency is the clock

Reading quinn 0.11 internals gave the missing piece:

- The endpoint receive loop does at most ~50 µs of work per poll
  (`RECV_TIME_BOUND`), the connection driver at most 20 datagrams per poll
  (`MAX_TRANSMIT_DATAGRAMS`), and both then *reschedule themselves* via
  `wake_by_ref`. Sustained throughput is therefore
  `(bounded work per poll) / (re-poll latency)`.
- On a runtime shared with the application's tasks, re-poll latency grows with
  app load. The raw-quinn probe (3 tasks) and the relay (7 tasks) re-polled in
  microseconds and flew; Felix (~50 tasks across 3 runtimes) did not.
- This also finally explains the per-byte exactness of rounds 1–6: wakeups
  scale with datagram count, datagrams scale with bytes/MTU, and each wakeup
  pays a fixed scheduler round trip. Per-message and per-frame costs never
  mattered because the datagram chain dominates.

**Fix 1 — dedicated I/O runtimes** (`crates/felix-transport`): quinn endpoints
get a `quinn::Runtime` implementation that spawns all driver tasks onto a pool
of *single-threaded* tokio runtimes (round-robin per endpoint,
`FELIX_IO_RUNTIME_THREADS`, default = available parallelism; the demo pins 2 —
see round 9). Driver self-wakes now re-poll immediately and never migrate
cores; on macOS the threads are pinned to high QoS. Measured: fast mode
appears at *default* settings for the first time — 121–137 K msg/s
(~500–560 MB/s) in most runs.

Verified along the way with a temporarily patched local quinn (raised
per-poll bounds, pacing off — diagnostic only, **removed**; the shipped fix
uses official crates exclusively): raising quinn's internal bounds was worth
only ~+20% once drivers were isolated, and pacing was not the residual
bottleneck.

## Round 9: the bimodality — batching vs per-datagram lockstep

With drivers isolated, runs are either ~90 MB/s or ~530 MB/s on identical
settings. What was established:

- Slow mode is a **self-sustaining per-datagram lockstep**: every stage (driver
  → driver → reader → ACK path back) processes one quantum per wakeup and
  parks. One cross-thread wakeup chain per ~16 KB datagram at ~200 µs ≈
  85 MB/s, invariant to write size, ACK frequency, queue depths and payload
  size — exactly the shape rounds 1–6 measured.
- Fast mode is the batched equilibrium: some queue depth exists, every poll
  amortises many datagrams, and the pipeline runs at the machine's real
  capacity.
- The equilibrium is selected around startup and is *sticky*, but **any
  perturbation flips slow → fast permanently** (attaching `sample` to the
  process reliably did it). It is a scheduling attractor, not a resource limit.
- Pool-size sweep confirms the mechanism: 1 io thread = never lockstep but
  serialized (~360 MB/s); 2 = mostly batched; 6–13 = hot drivers fully
  isolated from each other, lockstep dominates (~90 MB/s). Sharing a thread
  forces batching. Hence the demo (13 endpoints in one process) pins the pool
  to 2; a standalone broker has one endpoint and is indifferent.
- Forced all-E-core execution (`taskpolicy -b`) still reaches 190 MB/s — slow
  mode is *waiting*, not slow execution.

**Fix 2 — pump colocation** (`QuicConnection::spawn_pump`): the two tasks that
exchange a wakeup with the transport per datagram/write — the client's
subscription read task and the broker's per-connection delivery writer — are
spawned onto the same single-threaded runtime as their connection's drivers,
making those wakeups same-thread task switches. Worth ~+13% and shrinks the
lockstep window. The client *publisher* writer must NOT be colocated: it
blocks in `write_all` against a full send window and starves the drivers it
waits on (measured 5× loss).

## Round 10: ACK frequency, and levers that did not survive

**Fix 3 — ACK frequency** (`felix-transport`, quinn's ACK-frequency
extension): `max_ack_delay` 25 ms → 2 ms (a window-limited sender resumes only
on an ACK, so delayed ACKs stall the pipeline for the full delay) and
`ack_eliciting_threshold` 1 → 20 (each reverse-path ACK costs a datagram plus
its wakeup chain; at MTU 16354 the RFC every-other-packet cadence is ~2.5% of
datagram load and a disproportionate share of wakeups). Worth ~+15% end to
end. `FELIX_ACK_ELICITING_THRESHOLD` / `FELIX_ACK_FREQ_DISABLE` override.

Measured and rejected:

| Candidate | Verdict |
|---|---|
| Huge initial cwnd (`FELIX_INITIAL_CWND` up to 5 GB, which also disables quinn's pacer) | worse — burst loss thrash |
| Fixed-window congestion controller (official `congestion_controller_factory` API) | worse than Cubic for the same reason; removed |
| Colocating the client publisher writer | 5× worse; reverted |
| 1–4 MiB egress writes (`FELIX_SUB_MAX_BYTES_PER_WRITE`) | no change in either mode |
| Wider io pools for the in-process demo (4–13) | actively harmful (see round 9) |
| `--sub-shared-thread` | no change |
| Local quinn patches (per-poll bounds, pacer off) | diagnostic value only; ~+20%/tail-trimming not worth a fork; removed |

## Resolution summary

Root cause, one sentence: **Felix's throughput was clocked by scheduler wakeup
latency — one cross-thread wakeup chain per QUIC datagram — because quinn's
bounded-work driver tasks shared runtimes with all application tasks; every
per-stage measurement was fast because no stage was the problem.**

Shipped changes (official quinn/quinn-proto only):

1. `crates/felix-transport`: dedicated single-threaded I/O runtime pool for
   quinn drivers (`FELIX_IO_RUNTIME_THREADS`, default = available parallelism,
   `0` = old behaviour), macOS QoS pinning, `QuicConnection::spawn_pump`,
   ACK-frequency defaults (2 ms / threshold 20), `close_reason()` passthrough.
2. `crates/felix-client`: subscription read task colocated via `spawn_pump`;
   publisher writer deliberately not; client-side `FELIX_CONN_STATS_MS`
   diagnostics.
3. `services/broker`: per-connection delivery writer colocated via
   `spawn_pump`; `FELIX_CONN_STATS_MS` now logs `cwnd`/`rtt`.
4. `demos/broker/latency_demo.rs`: pins `FELIX_IO_RUNTIME_THREADS=2` for its
   13-endpoint single-process topology; honours
   `FELIX_EVENT_BATCH_MAX_BYTES`/`FELIX_SUB_MAX_BYTES_PER_WRITE` overrides.
5. Removed: the round-5 direct subscription writer (built, measured, no
   effect — deleted), the `FixedWindow` congestion mode, and every vendored
   quinn experiment.

Both perf profiles benefit: the throughput profile lands at ~550 MB/s p50 and
the latency profile measures p50 129 µs / p99 181 µs / p999 256 µs (the ACK
changes affect only transport acking, not request round trips).

## What remains open

- **The slow mode still occurs in a minority of in-process benchmark runs**
  (typically 1–2 of 12; ~20 K msg/s when it does). It is the round-9 lockstep
  attractor: startup-selected, sticky, flipped permanently by any external
  perturbation. It has never been observed to *degrade* a fast run mid-flight.
  A standalone broker with remote clients does not share the demo's
  13-endpoints-in-one-process scheduling surface, so measure there before
  chasing it further; `FELIX_IO_RUNTIME_THREADS` is the lever to sweep.
- **A load-sensitive test flake surfaced during this work**:
  `publish_sharding_preserves_stream_order` intermittently observed a
  contiguous gap (~100 events) under full-suite parallelism — including in
  configurations where every queue on the path is `Block`, which should make
  gaps impossible. It did not reproduce on unmodified `main` (12 runs) nor in
  the final 14-run verification, and its incidence tracked machine state more
  than any specific change. The test now collects the full received sequence
  and asserts at the end, so the next occurrence will show gap vs reorder vs
  cross-stream contamination directly. Worth its own investigation.
- `docs-site/.../benchmarks.md` numbers predate all of this (and round 1
  showed several were buffer-absorption artifacts). The full matrix should be
  re-run and republished.

## Note on MTU tuning

Round 1 suggested `mtu_discovery_upper_bound` of 8192 beat 16384 by ~30%. That
comparison came from buffer-absorbed 32 MB probe runs and **does not survive**
the corrected sweep: at valid run sizes the probe reaches 16354 and sustains
750–800 MB/s. Treat the 16384 default as fine and unproven-either-way, not as a
known 30% win. Note the QUIC spec distinction — Felix's
`initial_mtu` of 1200 is correctly RFC-safe and must stay conservative, since
RFC 9000 §14 requires PMTUD before exceeding ~1252 bytes on an unknown path.
The *discovery upper bound* is quinn's DPLPMTUD (RFC 8899) probing, which is
exactly that mechanism, so tuning it is spec-compliant. `FELIX_INITIAL_MTU` is
the knob that is genuinely unsafe on an unknown path.

## Reproducing

```sh
# Sustained (not buffer-absorbed) 4 KiB throughput
cargo run --release -p broker --bin latency-demo --all-features -- \
  --binary --warmup 1000 --total 60000 --payload 4096 --fanout 1 --batch 64

# Replay-ring A/B (flag added by this investigation)
... --log-capacity 1024

# CPU split
/usr/bin/time -l ./target/release/latency-demo --binary --warmup 1000 \
  --total 80000 --payload 4096 --fanout 1 --batch 64
```

Rule of thumb: **a run is only valid if `payload × total` comfortably exceeds
`send_window` (64 MiB).** Below that the harness reports buffer fill rate.

## Changes in the working tree

The shipped fix is described in "Resolution summary" above. Investigation-era
artifacts that remain deliberately:

- `demos/broker/latency_demo.rs`: `--log-capacity` / `FELIX_DEMO_LOG_CAPACITY`
  (defaults to the previous whole-run behaviour), and tracing init when
  `RUST_LOG` is set so broker/client diagnostics are reachable.
- `services/broker/src/transport/quic/conn.rs` and
  `crates/felix-client/src/client/client.rs`: `FELIX_CONN_STATS_MS` logs live
  `quinn::ConnectionStats` (MTU, cwnd, rtt, loss, blocked-frame counters) on
  both ends. Off unless the variable is set.

Removed after measuring: the round-5 direct subscription writer and its
`subscriber_direct_writer` config flag, the `FixedWindow` congestion mode, and
all vendored quinn/quinn-proto experiments.

Suggested follow-ups not yet done:

- Make `latency-demo` warn (or refuse to report) when run bytes fall below the
  send window, so the round-1 measurement artifact cannot silently return.
- Re-run and correct the affected tables in
  `docs-site/src/content/docs/features/benchmarks.md`, including the
  `core_shards` claims — the current numbers are both artifact-tainted (round 1)
  and now far below what the fixed pipeline delivers.
- Investigate the residual slow-mode tail and the
  `publish_sharding_preserves_stream_order` gap observation (see "What remains
  open").

## Round 11: four defects in the measurement pipeline

The first full post-fix matrix (2,240 cases, several hours) produced numbers
that contradicted hand measurement by 5×. None of the causes were in Felix.
All four are fixed; they are recorded because each one silently produces
plausible-looking wrong data.

### 1. The raw log is append-only and everything read all of it

`data/raw/latency_demo_runs.jsonl` accumulates every run ever performed.
`normalize_and_aggregate.py` read the whole file, so the derived CSVs and every
chart mixed **six code states**: of 5,682 rows, only 2,257 were the new run.
The rest were commits from three days earlier.

`git_sha` cannot separate them, because the interesting changes are uncommitted
— several sessions share one sha with `git_dirty: true`. That is what the
tooling's own warning ("their git_sha does not identify what was measured") was
telling us.

**Fix.** Each matrix invocation stamps a `session_id`;
`normalize_and_aggregate.py` derives from the latest session only, and reports
what it dropped (`--session all` / `--session <prefix>` to override). Applied
to the existing data: 2,257 kept, 3,425 stale rows excluded, charts fell from
192 files across 6 commits to 80 from one session.

### 2. Charts held a single bar with everything else "no data"

A direct consequence of (1): old sessions had only ever run a fraction of the
matrix, so their chart groups were nearly all absent. `make_charts.py` renders
missing cells as NaN, which is correct, but a figure where *every* bar is
absent is worse than no figure. It now skips such figures, and with session
filtering there are no incomplete groups left (448 rows, 0 incomplete).

### 3. Message rate on a linear axis made large payloads look like zero

The throughput charts plotted msg/s across payloads 0–4096 on one linear axis.
0 B does ~3.7M msg/s and 4 KiB does ~21K, so the 4 KiB bar was 0.6% of the
tallest and rendered as nothing — reading as "4 KiB has no throughput" when it
was in fact moving the most *bytes* on the chart.

**Fix.** Log y-axis on message-rate charts, plus a new
`_delivered_mb_per_s` chart, which is the only cross-payload-comparable
throughput measure. 0 B is excluded from it rather than drawn as a zero bar.

### 4. The demo's own sweep measured buffer fill

`--all` hardcoded `total = 5000` for every payload — 20 MB at 4 KiB, well
inside the 64 MiB send window. Sizing is now per payload, with a floor that
clears the window whenever affordable and a cap on *delivered* messages so a
20-case sweep stays ~40 s. Only combinations where clearing the window would
cost millions of deliveries (small payloads at high fanout) still warn.

Two constraints the sizing has to respect: the undersized-run warning must skip
`payload = 0` (zero volume always trips a byte threshold, which is meaningless
for empty payloads), and the counts need a wall-clock cap or a 20-case sweep
becomes a multi-minute benchmark.

### Why this mattered more than it looks

The matrix's throughput half was **unusable**: 45% of `batch=64` cells had
p90/p10 trial spread above 1.5×, some 7.2×, and the medians mostly landed in
the degraded mode (~87–114 MB/s — near the *pre-fix* ceiling) while hand
measurement on an idle machine gave 477–509 MB/s. Publishing those would have
reported the bug as the product's performance.

**Background CPU load makes the degraded mode much more likely**, so a matrix
run that overlaps with compilation, a test suite or a docs build is
contaminated. Run the matrix on an otherwise idle machine.

The latency half of the same matrix was fine — 224 cells, only 15% with
meaningful spread — and is the basis for the published latency table.

## Round 12: the bimodality is endpoint→I/O-runtime placement (half of it)

### It is not idle waiting

The decisive measurement. Same command, one fast run and one slow, under
`/usr/bin/time -l`:

| | fast | slow | ratio |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| delivered | 120K msg/s | 20K msg/s | 6× |
| wall | 0.80 s | 3.39 s | |
| cores busy | 1.90 | 1.94 | **same** |
| **sys time per message** | **15.0 µs** | **85.8 µs** | **5.7×** |
| **context switches per message** | **0.42** | **2.40** | **5.7×** |

Both modes saturate the same ~1.9 cores. The slow mode is not blocked on a
timer or starved of CPU — it performs **5.7× more kernel work per message**.
That is the lockstep, quantified: one wakeup chain per item instead of one per
batch.

### It is client-side, and the broker is innocent

Per-stage timings, fast vs slow (p99):

| stage | fast | slow | ratio |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `client_sub_read_await` | 672 µs | 13.711 ms | **20.4×** |
| `client_sub_poll_gap` | 674 µs | 13.713 ms | 20.3× |
| `client_write` / `client_send_await` | 4.543 ms | 28.138 ms | 6.2× |
| `broker_sub_write` | 5 µs | 4 µs | 0.8× |
| `broker_decode` | 69 µs | 79 µs | 1.1× |
| `broker_publish_append` | 6 µs | 8 µs | 1.3× |

**Every broker stage is unchanged.** The broker writes in 4 µs and the client
waits 13.7 ms to receive it. Both client directions are affected, which points
at the client's I/O runtime rather than either data path.

### What selects it: which endpoints share a runtime

Endpoints were assigned to I/O runtimes round-robin. Slow-run rate by pool size,
8 runs each:

| pool | before grouping | after grouping |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0/8 (but capped ~345 MB/s — one thread serializes) | — |
| 2 | 1/8 | 2/8 |
| 3 | **7/8** | — |
| 4 | 7/8 | 3/8 |
| 6 | **8/8** | **1/8** |

Two configurations were *deterministic*, which is what made this tractable:
`--sub-shared-thread` was 8/8 slow, and pool size 6 was 8/8 slow. Logging the
assignment showed the difference is not the pattern but which endpoints land
together:

- **fast** — broker endpoint alone on runtime 0; client publish + client event share runtime 1
- **slow** — broker endpoint shares runtime 0 with the client's event endpoint

Mechanism: the server endpoint drives every connection in both directions, so
sharing it with anything starves it; and a client's publish and event endpoints
carry the two halves of one request/response flow, so splitting *them* makes
every message pay two cross-thread wakes.

**Fix** (`crates/felix-transport/src/lib.rs`): assignment is by role, with
disjoint runtime slots that do not depend on creation order.

```rust
Server => sequence % (pool_len - 1),   // never the last runtime
Client => pool_len - 1,                // always the last runtime
```

Reserving the last runtime for clients is what makes the partition stable. A
history-dependent selection (`seq % pool_len` for servers) alternates them onto
the client runtime as endpoints accumulate, which matters wherever many
endpoints are created in one process — see round 14.

Default pool size dropped from available-parallelism to **2** — a bigger pool
cannot make a single endpoint faster (an endpoint's driver is one task on one
runtime) and actively splits communicating endpoints. The old default was
chosen to relieve a parallel-test-suite flake, never for throughput.

This eliminated the pool-size sensitivity — including the 8/8 and 7/8
deterministic cases — and **raised nothing else**: fast-mode throughput is
unchanged at ~122K msg/s (500 MB/s) against 123K before.

### Also ruled out this round

| Hypothesis | Result |
|---|---|
| Path MTU stuck low | both modes reach 16354 |
| Packet loss / congestion | 0 lost, 0 congestion events, both modes |
| Partially-filled datagrams | ~15.6 KB/datagram in both |
| App runtime width | ~1/8 slow at 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 worker threads |
| I/O pool size (after grouping) | 1–3/8 at every size |
| Event connection pool | 1/8 at pool 1, 2/8 at pool 8 |
| `cargo run` vs direct binary | no difference (an earlier claim that it *did* was a zsh word-splitting bug in the test harness — see below) |

### Scripting the demo

**zsh does not word-split unquoted parameter expansions.** Passing the demo's
arguments through a shell variable (`$ARGS`) delivers them as a single string,
which the parser ignores — the demo then falls back to its full built-in sweep
and reports a different benchmark entirely. Pass literal arguments, or a shell
array, when scripting runs.

## Round 13: the residual, and how not to misread a sweep

### The residual bimodality

**~30% of runs land 5–6× slower**, on every configuration tested, measured in
fresh processes after the round-14 fixes: median 118,011 msg/s (483 MB/s), eight
runs 116K–122K, four runs 20–23K. Role-based placement removed the
assignment-dependent component; this is a second, independent cause.

What is known about it:

- costs 5.7× system time and 5.7× context switches per message (round 12)
- client-side; every broker stage is unaffected
- sticky for the life of the process, selected at startup
- much more likely under background CPU load
- not explained by MTU, loss, datagram fill, runtime width, pool size, or
  connection pool size

### Test flake, cause not established

`publish_sharding_preserves_stream_order` fails intermittently under full-suite
parallelism — never in isolation (4/4 passes at every pool setting), and the
failure is a **2-second timeout, not a data gap**. Rate has ranged from 0/12 to
2/4 across sessions, correlating with machine load; the last five suite runs
were clean.

Unresolved concern: the I/O runtime pool is **process-global**, so the whole
test binary now shares 2 threads where it previously had 16. That is a
plausible interaction with parallel tests and should be checked before the
default is committed. Setting a larger pool for the test suite is the obvious
mitigation if it recurs.

### The single-run trap

The `--all` sweep runs **one trial per case**. With a ~30% slow rate, several
cases in any sweep will read 5–7× low — two adjacent cases in the log above
differ 5.7× and 7.1× on identical settings. `--all` is a smoke demo; anything
quoted must come from `task perf:latency-matrix`, which medians five trials.

Related output fix: the demo printed queueing delay for `batch > 1` runs under
the same `p50 =` label as real request latency. Those percentiles scale with
run length by design — lengthening runs to clear the send window made them grow
from single-digit ms to hundreds of ms, which reads as a catastrophic
regression and is not one. Batched runs now print under an explicit
`queueing delay (NOT per-message latency ...)` heading.

## Round 14: benchmark lifecycle — assignment stability and drop accounting

Two defects in the benchmark's lifecycle handling distorted the round-13 sweep:
endpoint assignment drifted across repeated in-process cases, and subscriber
timeouts were counted as queue drops. Both are fixed here, and the numbers are
re-measured afterwards.

### Endpoint assignment must not depend on creation history

The round-12 fix partitioned endpoints by *role* but still chose the slot from
creation history: `Server => seq % pool_len`. With the default pool of 2 and
`--all` calling `run_case()` repeatedly in one process, that alternates:

| case | server runtime | clients | result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0 | 1 | isolated — fast |
| 2 | **1** | 1 | **server shares with clients — slow** |
| 3 | 0 | 1 | fast |
| … | alternating | always 1 | alternating |

So every second case rebuilt precisely the topology round 12 set out to
eliminate. The verification missed it because it used one endpoint pair per
process, where the counters never advance far enough to wrap.

**Confirmed against the round-13 sweep log.** Predicting "odd-indexed case is
slower" from this model alone:

| # | payload | fanout | delivered/s | vs previous |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 10 | 1 KiB | 1 | 396,692 | — |
| 11 | 1 KiB | 1 | 314,002 | 1.3× slower |
| 12 | 1 KiB | 10 | 738,852 | — |
| 13 | 1 KiB | 10 | 129,991 | **5.7× slower** |
| 14 | 4 KiB | 1 | 108,146 | — |
| 15 | 4 KiB | 1 | 80,607 | 1.3× slower |
| 16 | 4 KiB | 10 | 192,867 | — |
| 17 | 4 KiB | 10 | 26,987 | **7.1× slower** |
| 18 | 256 B | 1 | 1,298,113 | — |
| 19 | 256 B | 1 | 977,113 | 1.3× slower |

**5 of 5 pairs**, and the two extremes are the fanout-10 cases where the server
endpoint does the most work and suffers most from sharing. What round 13 called
bimodality inside the sweep was deterministic alternation.

**Fix.** Reserve disjoint slots by role, independent of history:

```rust
Server => sequence % (pool_len - 1),   // never the last runtime
Client => pool_len - 1,                // always the last runtime
```

With the default pool of 2 every server is pinned to runtime 0 and every client
to runtime 1, forever. Verified over a full 20-case sweep: **14 servers → 0,
126 clients → 1**, no drift. Worst same-config pair ratio fell from 7.1× to
**1.02×**.

### Subscriber timeouts are not queue drops

`dropped` was `expected_delivered_total - delivered_total`, and drain
subscribers `break` out of their loop on a 2 s idle timeout, abandoning
whatever remained. Any slow run therefore reports a large "drop" count that has
nothing to do with queue policy.

**Fix.** A subscriber that times out, errors, or sees its stream close now
fails the run with context instead of abandoning events. The field is renamed
`unaccounted` and documented as a shortfall, not a drop counter — the real
counters are `metrics` counters with no recorder installed in the demo, so they
are honestly not collected here. A non-zero value now prints
`sanity: INVALID RUN ... throughput above is not meaningful`.

Post-fix sweep: **0 of 14 runs invalid**, against two cases previously
reporting 260K and 134K phantom drops.

### What remains

A genuine residual, in fresh processes where server 0 always lands on runtime 0:

```
4 KiB, fanout 1, 12 fresh processes
median 118,011 msg/s (483 MB/s)
slow: 4/12  ->  20, 20, 21, 23 K msg/s
```

So ~30% of runs still land 5–6× slow, and this one is not explained by
endpoint placement. It is the same residual round 13 described; what has
changed is that it can now be measured without the harness contaminating it,
and that its supposed "shedding" symptom has evaporated.

Everything round 12 established about its *character* still stands, because
those measurements were single-case, single-process runs unaffected by the
alternation bug: same cores busy, 5.7× system time and 5.7× context switches
per message, client-side, every broker stage unchanged.

### Verifying changes in this area

Two things this class of bug requires:

1. **Exercise repeated cases, not one.** Endpoint assignment is process-global
   and history-dependent bugs only appear once counters have advanced, so a
   single endpoint pair per process cannot expose them. Check the assignment
   log (`RUST_LOG=felix_transport=debug`) over a full sweep.
2. **Check what a counter measures before drawing conclusions from it.**
   `unaccounted` is `expected - observed`, not a queue-drop counter; the real
   drop counters are `metrics` counters and are not collected by the demo.

### Current verified state

| Profile | Result |
|---|---|
| Latency, fanout 1 | p50 109–119 µs, p99 138–165 µs |
| Latency, fanout 10 | p50 236–245 µs, p99 343–356 µs |
| Throughput 4 KiB fanout 1 | median 118,011 msg/s = **483 MB/s**, ~30% of runs slow |
| Invalid runs in a 20-case sweep | 0 |
| Worst same-config pair ratio | 1.02× |

`task lint`, `task test` (twice) and `task demo:check` all pass.

### Next step

One item remains: the ~30% fresh-process slow rate. The standalone-broker
reproduction is still the right next move — a real broker has one endpoint and
its clients are separate processes, so if the residual does not reproduce
there, it is a property of the single-process harness rather than of Felix.

## Round 16: the "Linux delivery stall" is publish-side shedding

CI (ubuntu runners) failed on a branch that was green on macOS:
`publish_sharding_preserves_stream_order` timed out after 30 s. Reproduced in
a Linux container (`--cpus 4`): passes 4/4 in 0.4 s at the PR base, hangs 4/4
on the branch **in isolation**, and only `FELIX_IO_RUNTIME_THREADS=0` cured
it — so the dedicated I/O runtime pool looked responsible.

### The wrong turn, and what corrected it

A `quinn_proto=trace` capture showed the last activity before a 29.8 s gap
was a stream frame *arriving and being ACKed* at the receiver, after which
every connection died of idle timeout. Read alone, that says "the QUIC layer
accepted bytes the application was never woken to read", and the obvious
conclusion is a lost wakeup caused by isolating the drivers.

That conclusion was wrong, and two things falsified it:

- **A minimal reproduction would not reproduce.** 400 small items over one
  uni stream, read either colocated (`spawn_pump`) or from the application
  runtime, passes 3/3 at pool sizes 0, 1 and 2. Both variants are kept as
  regression tests (`many_small_frames_reach_a_colocated_reader`,
  `many_small_frames_reach_an_app_runtime_reader`).
- **Walking the chain end to end found the events missing much earlier.**
  The client stalls with 256 free queue slots (no backpressure); both lane
  feeders sit in `event_rx.recv()`; the per-connection writer's last write
  completes `ok=true` and it never receives another command. Everything
  downstream is idle because there is nothing left to deliver.

### The actual cause

Counting at each stage settles it. The broker's control loop reads **444
frames** — all 400 publishes plus setup — but `publish_batch_to_handle` runs
only **128 times**, and instrumenting checkpoint 4 shows **77 publishes
explicitly dropped** in a single run:

```
DBG ingest: DROPPED (queue full, policy=Drop)   x77
```

Checkpoint 4 — the per-worker publish ingress queue, depth 64 — defaults to
`EnqueuePolicy::Drop`. The test pins `Block` on the broker's subscriber queue,
the lane queue and the client's subscriber queue, but leaves publish ingress
at its default, then asserts that all 200 events per stream arrive in order.
With unacked publishes there is no backpressure to the client, so a 400-message
burst that outruns the broker core is shed **by design**, and the test waits
forever for events that were never published.

**The I/O runtime pool did not break anything.** It made ingest fast enough to
outrun the broker core on a 4-CPU box, which exposed a test that was asking for
lossless delivery without configuring for it. macOS never showed it because the
workers drained faster than the reader filled the queue.

### The fix

`pub_ingress_wait: true` in that test's `BrokerConfig`, which switches
checkpoint 4 to `Backpressure` — the same combination
`internals-concurrency.md` already documents as the requirement for lossless
mode, and the one the benchmark harness uses. Note the env var
(`FELIX_PUB_INGRESS_WAIT`) is *not* enough here: the test builds
`BrokerConfig::default()` directly rather than `from_env()`.

The pool default returns to `2` on every platform.

### Verification (Linux container, pool enabled)

| Suite | Result |
|---|---|
| `publish_sharding_preserves_stream_order` | 6/6 pass |
| broker lib | 245/245 |
| felix-client lib | 76/76 |
| felix-transport lib | 13/13 |
| `latency_text` integration | pass |

### What this cost, and the lesson

Two commits of misdiagnosis: first blaming the pool, then gating it to macOS.
The trace evidence was real but read one layer too low — an ACKed-but-unread
frame at the transport is equally consistent with "the sender stopped
producing", and the sender had. **Count the item at every stage before
concluding anything from a wakeup-shaped symptom**: 444 in, 128 through,
77 dropped located the defect in one run, after several rounds of transport
theory had not.

Worth carrying separately: a 400-message unacked burst shedding ~19% at
default settings on a 4-CPU host is *documented* behaviour, not a bug — but
it is a sharper edge than the docs' "overload becomes visible" framing
suggests, and worth revisiting when the ingress queue depth is next tuned.

## Everything changed this session

All uncommitted. Grouped by what would make sensible commits.

**Transport (`crates/felix-transport/src/lib.rs`)**
- `EndpointRole`: server endpoints get a runtime each, client endpoints share
  one. Replaces round-robin assignment (round 12).
- Default I/O pool size available-parallelism → **2**.
- Debug log of endpoint → runtime assignment (`felix_transport=debug`).
- Round 15: loopback peers connect/accept with `initial_mtu = min_mtu =
  16336` (skips discovery, makes MTU black-hole verdicts a no-op); initial
  congestion window scaled per RFC 9002 when the initial MTU exceeds quinn's
  flat 14,720-byte default (which otherwise deadlocks the handshake);
  `black_hole_cooldown` 60 s → 2 s with `FELIX_MTU_BLACK_HOLE_COOLDOWN_MS`
  override.

**Client (`crates/felix-client/`)**
- `client.rs`: `FELIX_CONN_STATS_MS` path-stats logger (client is the sender on
  the publish path, so its cwnd/rtt is invisible from broker stats).
- `subscription.rs`: subscription read task colocated via `spawn_pump`.
- The publisher writer is deliberately *not* colocated — it blocks in
  `write_all` and starves the drivers it waits on (measured 5× worse).
- `publisher.rs`/`wire/ack.rs`: acked publishes are pipelined. The writer no
  longer awaits each broker ack inline (which capped acked throughput per
  stream at one request per RTT — ~9.4 K msg/s on loopback, ~20/s on a 50 ms
  WAN); it hands written requests to a per-stream ack-reader task that
  resolves them in order as acks arrive. Admission permits ride with the
  pending ack so the in-flight byte budget still reflects unacked data. Ack
  failure semantics unchanged: timeout, decode error, mismatched or error
  acks remain fatal for the worker and fail queued requests. Regression test
  `acked_publishes_pipeline_without_waiting_per_ack` deadlocks (10 s timeout)
  against the inline-wait implementation and passes in milliseconds with
  pipelining.

**Broker (`services/broker/`)**
- `conn.rs`: `FELIX_CONN_STATS_MS` now logs `cwnd` and `rtt`.
- `subscribe/lane.rs`: per-connection delivery writer colocated via
  `spawn_pump`.
- `streams/tests.rs`: `publish_sharding_preserves_stream_order` now pins Block
  queue policies and collects the full received sequence before asserting, so a
  failure shows gap vs reorder vs contamination.

**Perf tooling (`scripts/perf/`)**
- `run_latency_matrix.py`: `session_id` per invocation; `effective_total()`
  sizes throughput cases past the send window.
- `normalize_and_aggregate.py`: `select_session()`, latest-session default,
  reports excluded stale runs.
- `make_charts.py`: log y-axis for message-rate charts, new
  `_delivered_mb_per_s` chart, skip all-NaN figures.
- `presets.yml` / `ci_subset_throughput.yml`: documented `min_run_bytes` /
  `max_total`.

**Demo (`demos/broker/latency_demo.rs`)**
- Subscriber timeout, stream error or early close now fails the run with
  context instead of abandoning remaining events.
- `dropped` renamed `unaccounted` (`expected - observed`, not a drop counter);
  a non-zero value prints `sanity: INVALID RUN`.
- `throughput_total(payload, fanout)`: window floor when affordable, delivered-
  message cap otherwise.
- Undersized-run warning, skipped for empty payloads.
- Batched runs print `queueing delay (NOT per-message latency ...)` instead of
  a bare `p50 =`.
- Removed the redundant `FELIX_IO_RUNTIME_THREADS=2` pin (now the default).

**Docs**
- `benchmarks.md`: post-fix latency table, clean throughput table with the
  spread column, two latency charts, methodology sections on the send-window
  rule and session isolation; old cross-platform tables demoted and marked
  pre-fix.
- `performance-case-study.md` (new, in the docs site): the narrative version.
- `internals-concurrency.md`: "The QUIC I/O runtime" section.
- Animated Mermaid diagrams restored from a stash and extended
  (`how-felix-works`, `getting-started/overview`, `internals-subscribe`,
  `performance.md`, durable-storage); `group-commit.svg` wired in.
- `environment-variables.md`: `FELIX_IO_RUNTIME_THREADS`,
  `FELIX_ACK_ELICITING_THRESHOLD`, `FELIX_ACK_FREQ_DISABLE`,
  `FELIX_CONN_STATS_MS`.

**Not done**
- Cross-page number cleanup. `quic-transport.md` still claims connection
  throughput "scales nearly linearly" with a table (150K → 3.2M msg/s) that was
  never measured and that round 6 contradicted pre-fix; `pubsub.md` has an
  unsourced fanout table including a fanout-1000 row that has never been
  benchmarked; `system-design.md` says 10k–50k msg/s, two orders of magnitude
  below every other page; `what-felix-is-for.md` quotes buffer-absorbed figures
  without the caveat its source page now carries.

## Round 15: the residual is a path-MTU collapse, not scheduling

Reproduced first: 5/16 fresh-process runs at ~21–24 K msg/s against a
~118–120 K fast mode (4 KiB, fanout 1, batch 64) — the round-13/14 residual,
alive and well.

### The lockstep theory, tested and killed

The standing theory was a park/wake lockstep between the two I/O runtime
threads. Tested directly: a bounded busy-wait in `on_thread_park` on the I/O
runtimes (so a thread about to park stays runnable through the inter-datagram
gap, turning cross-thread wakes into flag checks). Result: slow-run rate
unchanged at every spin length (2/12 at 0 µs, ~3/16 at 100 µs, 5/12 at
500 µs) — and the 100 µs run introduced *new* intermediate modes, because in
tokio the parked worker is what polls the I/O driver, so spinning before the
park delays datagram receipt. Wrong theory, and the instrument perturbed the
system. Removed entirely.

### What a slow run actually looks like

`FELIX_CONN_STATS_MS=250` on a fast and a slow run, busiest connection (the
client publish connection carrying all traffic), final stats:

| | fast | slow |
|---|---|---|
| MTU at end of run | 16354 | **1200** |
| UDP datagrams for ~230–260 MB | 14,278 | **166,580** |
| bytes per datagram | 15,744 | **1,549** |
| lost packets | 0 | 674 (one burst) |

Timeline of the slow run's publish connection:

```
t=0.25s  mtu=8792   cwnd=17584     rtt=1.9ms   lost=0     (discovery in progress)
t=0.50s  mtu=16354  cwnd=15.3MB    rtt=13.2ms  lost=0     (discovery SUCCEEDED)
t=0.75s  mtu=1200   cwnd=9.9MB     rtt=2.9ms   lost=674   (collapse)
t=1.5s   mtu=1200   ...            ...         lost=674   (stuck; no further loss)
t=3.0s   mtu=1200   ...            ...         lost=674   (stuck until run ends)
```

Path-MTU discovery *succeeds*, then a single ~674-packet loss burst drops the
MTU back to 1200 for the rest of the run. At 1200 instead of 16354 the same
byte stream costs ~13.6× the datagrams — and each datagram carries a syscall
and a wakeup chain, which is precisely the 5.7× system time and 5.7× context
switches per message round 12 measured. Every earlier observation fits:
client-side (the client is the publish-path sender), broker stages unaffected,
sticky from "startup" (the collapse lands in the first second, during the
warmup ramp), and worse under background CPU load (see below). Round 2's
"80.3 MB/s anomaly with MTU collapsed to 1200 and 649 lost packets" — recorded
once, not reproduced, set aside — was this defect.

Round 12's "MTU reaches 16354 in both modes" check was made on a delivery
connection; the collapse hits the *publish* connection carrying the offered
load. The check was right and looked at the wrong connection.

### Mechanism, in three parts

1. **The loss burst is congestive, not an MTU problem.** The publish path's
   standing queue (~6.5 MB: 4 MiB payload inflight plus overhead, visible as
   the 13 ms loopback "RTT") sits within ~1.5 MB of the receiver's 8 MB UDP
   socket buffer (`kern.ipc.maxsockbuf` caps it there). A scheduling stall of
   a few ms on the draining side overflows the buffer and the kernel drops a
   window of packets. Background CPU load makes such stalls — and therefore
   the collapse — much more likely. If the ramp survives without a burst,
   steady state is loss-free (fast runs: 0 lost packets), hence bimodal.
2. **Quinn's black-hole detector cannot tell the difference.** Every dropped
   packet in the burst is full-MTU (that is what a saturated sender's traffic
   looks like), which is exactly the "large packets vanish" signature the
   detector looks for (`BLACK_HOLE_THRESHOLD` = 3 suspicious bursts). Verdict:
   MTU black hole. The path MTU resets to `initial_mtu` (1200) and MTU
   discovery enters a 60 s cooldown (`black_hole_cooldown` default).
3. **Recovery is starved by the load itself.** Quinn only sends an MTU probe
   when a `poll_transmit` finds nothing else to send
   (`if buf.is_empty()` in `connection/mod.rs`). A backlogged publisher never
   has an empty transmit buffer, so after the cooldown no probe is ever sent.
   Verified: with the cooldown shortened to 2 s (A/B via
   `FELIX_MTU_BLACK_HOLE_COOLDOWN_MS`), collapsed runs stayed at MTU 1200 for
   2.7+ s past the collapse with zero probes and zero further losses, and the
   slow-run rate was unchanged (3/16 at 2 s vs 4/16 at 60 s). The collapse is
   sticky for the life of the *load*, not the cooldown.

### The fix, in three attempts

The fix took three iterations, each of which taught something about quinn's
MTU machinery; recorded because every intermediate state *looked* plausible
and shipped alone would not have worked.

1. **Initial MTU alone is not enough — the handshake deadlocks.** Starting
   loopback connections at `initial_mtu = 16336` hit a second quinn surprise:
   the default initial congestion window is a flat 14,720 bytes (RFC 9002's
   constant, sized for ~1200-byte datagrams, not MTU-scaled) and quinn's send
   path reserves a full segment per datagram — so an initial MTU larger than
   the window blocks the very first packet on congestion control, forever.
   This also means a hand-set `FELIX_INITIAL_MTU=16354` had always been a
   deadlock. Fixed by scaling the window with RFC 9002's own formula
   (`clamp(14720, 2×mtu, 10×mtu)` = 32,672 at 16,336) whenever no explicit
   `FELIX_INITIAL_CWND` is set and the MTU requires it.
2. **Initial MTU + window is still not enough — the collapse floor is
   `min_mtu`.** With connections starting and running at 16336, slow runs
   continued at the same ~30% rate, and the capture showed why: the busy
   publish connection began at 16336 and a loss burst still dropped it to
   **1200**. Quinn's black-hole reset target is `TransportConfig::min_mtu`
   (default 1200), not `initial_mtu`. Raising the start size alone changes
   nothing about the failure mode.
3. **The actual fix: guarantee the loopback MTU.** For a loopback peer —
   the one path where a 16 KiB datagram is guaranteed by construction — the
   config variant sets both `initial_mtu` *and* `min_mtu` to 16336 (fits
   IPv4/IPv6 headers within the 16 KiB loopback interface MTU; capped by
   `FELIX_MTU_UPPER_BOUND`/`FELIX_MAX_UDP_PAYLOAD`). With the floor at
   16336 a black-hole verdict has nothing to collapse to: congestive loss
   bursts remain ordinary congestion events and Cubic absorbs them. Applied
   on both sides: `QuicClient::connect` via `connect_with` and
   `QuicServer::accept` via `accept_with`, whenever the peer address is
   loopback. An explicit `FELIX_INITIAL_MTU` disables the special case.
   `min_mtu` must never be raised for a real network path.
4. **And pin the discovery bound, or quiet connections starve.** With
   `initial_mtu = 16336` but the probe bound still at 16384, MTUD probes for
   sizes that can never fit (16384 minus IP/UDP headers is less than the
   probe). A probe is full-MTU, bypasses the congestion check when sent, and
   counts against the window once in flight — so on a *quiet* connection at
   the two-segment initial window, the doomed probe → loss-detection →
   retransmit cycle starves every ordinary small send behind it ("blocked by
   congestion control" for tens of seconds). Busy connections never noticed
   (Cubic grows the window past caring), which is why the throughput sweeps
   missed it; a client test with a sparse request/ack exchange hung reliably.
   The loopback config therefore sets `upper_bound = initial_mtu`: the size
   is guaranteed, there is nothing to discover, no probe is ever sent.
5. **And gate the whole guarantee on the granted socket buffers.** CI turned
   up the converse failure: on stock Linux, `SO_RCVBUF` is silently clamped
   to `net.core.rmem_max` (~208 KB — about 26 jumbo datagrams of headroom
   against ~350 at MTU 1200), and sustained batch load overflowed it so
   badly that every CI throughput trial and the 4 KiB batch integration test
   timed out. Worse, the pinned `min_mtu` forbids the one thing that helps a
   tiny buffer: smaller datagrams. The guarantee now applies only when the
   socket's *achieved* send/receive buffers (read back post-bind — the
   configured size says nothing on Linux) hold at least 64 full-size
   datagrams (~1 MiB); below that, connections keep the stock RFC-safe path.
   macOS grants the requested 8 MiB and keeps the fast path; stock-limit
   Linux hosts fall back until `rmem_max`/`wmem_max` are raised.

Additionally, `black_hole_cooldown` drops 60 s → 2 s
(`FELIX_MTU_BLACK_HOLE_COOLDOWN_MS`) for non-loopback paths. It cannot rescue
a continuously backlogged sender (probe starvation, above), but for
intermittent load it turns a spurious collapse into a ≤2 s dent instead of a
60 s outage, at the cost of one loss-tolerant probe per cooldown on a genuine
black-hole path.

### Verification

4 KiB × batch 64 × fanout 1, fresh process per run, same binary for both arms
(the reverted arm disables the loopback guarantee via `FELIX_INITIAL_MTU=1200`
and restores the stock cooldown):

| Arm | Slow runs | Median | Worst ÷ median |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| Baseline (before any of this round) | 5/16 at ~21–24 K | ~118 K msg/s | 5.6× |
| Fix active | **0/20** | ~122 K msg/s | **1.11×** |
| Fix reverted via env | 5/16 at ~21–23 K | ~121 K msg/s | 5.7× |

The fix arm's 20 runs span 112.3–125.1 K msg/s. The fast mode itself gained
~3% from skipping the MTU discovery ramp.

The round-14 open item — reproduce on a standalone broker before chasing
further — is answered by mechanism: the collapse requires overflowing the
receiver's UDP socket buffer with full-MTU packets, which any sufficiently
fast sender can do to any receiver on any high-MTU path; it was never a
property of the in-process harness. Loopback deployments are now immune by
construction; non-loopback paths degrade for ≤2 s per spurious verdict when
their load has idle gaps, and a continuously saturated non-loopback sender
remains exposed to probe starvation — a quinn behavior worth an upstream
conversation.
