# Felix MVP To-Do List

**The MVP described here was completed, and Felix has moved well past it.** This
file is kept as the historical checklist and for the design sketches and answered
open questions further down, which are still the reasoning behind the current
storage layer.

It is **not** the place to look for current status. Two places are:

- The [status table](https://gabloe.github.io/felix/getting-started/what-felix-is-for/),
  kept current per capability, and the authority when anything disagrees with it.
- [GitHub issues and milestones](https://github.com/gabloe/felix/issues) for what
  is being worked on.

## What the MVP Achieved
A single-node broker that accepts QUIC connections, supports publish/subscribe
over a framed v1 protocol, and provides an in-memory TTL cache — focused on
correctness and operability rather than durability, clustering, or advanced
observability. Durability, clustering, replication, failover, the log-backed
cache, and consumer groups all landed afterwards.

---

## Build + repo health (Done)
- [X] `cargo build --workspace` succeeds cleanly
- [X] `cargo test --workspace` exists and runs
- [X] `Taskfile.yml` targets: `build`, `test`, `fmt`, `lint`, `demo`
- [X] Add CI workflow: fmt, clippy, test
- [X] Add baseline deps management: `cargo-deny` + `deny.toml`

## Wire protocol v1 (`felix-wire`)
- [X] Versioned frame header (magic/version/flags/len)
- [ ] Add message type in header (type field) for faster dispatch
- [X] Message types: `Publish`, `Subscribe`, `Event`, `CachePut`, `CacheGet`, `CacheValue`, `Ok`, `Error`
- [X] Encode/decode message payloads with frames
- [X] Define v1 wire spec in `docs/protocol.md`
- [X] Add test vectors in `crates/protocol/felix-wire/tests/vectors/`
- [X] Add conformance runner tool (felix-conformance)
- [ ] Add fuzz tests for frame + message decoding (storage decoding is covered:
      see `crates/server/felix-storage/fuzz/`)
- [ ] Add compatibility notes (reserved fields for future encryption/compression)

## QUIC transport (`felix-transport`)
- [X] QUIC server endpoint wrapper (quinn)
- [X] QUIC client endpoint wrapper
- [X] Connection info + stream helpers (bi/uni)
- [X] Graceful shutdown hooks (drain connections on SIGTERM) — see
      [Graceful Shutdown](../docs-site/src/content/docs/deployment/graceful-shutdown.md).
      Readiness flip, accept-loop cancellation, and a bounded per-connection drain
      (`TaskTracker` grace window, then the connection is closed) are done. Cancelling
      each subsystem individually was deliberately *not* the design: publish and
      subscribe streams are long-lived by construction, so waiting on them would hang
      exactly as long as waiting on the connection. What is still untested is a real
      signal: `run_with_shutdown` is driven by a synthetic future in tests, and nothing
      sends an actual SIGTERM to a running process.
- [X] Backpressure defaults (caps per connection/subscription)

## Broker core (`felix-broker`)
- [X] In-memory stream registry (explicit registration)
- [X] Fanout to N subscribers
- [X] Cursor model (tail-only is fine for MVP)
- [X] Append-only in-memory log per stream (ring buffer)
- [X] Cache: `Put/Get` with TTL expiry
- [X] Cache eviction policy placeholder (size cap + LRU later)

## Broker service (`services/felix-broker-service`)
- [X] Wire QUIC transport to broker protocol handler
- [X] Env var for QUIC bind address (`FELIX_QUIC_BIND`)
- [X] Health endpoints: `/live`, `/ready`
- [X] Metrics endpoint (Prometheus)

## Demo + examples (Done)
- [X] QUIC broker demo using framed messages
- [X] Demo for cache `put/get` over QUIC (or document separate cache API)
- [X] Demo for testing latency with a comprehensive-ish matrix

## MVP Definition of Done
- [X] Single broker accepts QUIC connections
- [X] Client can publish to a named stream over QUIC
- [X] Subscribers receive stream events over QUIC
- [X] Cache `put/get` available over QUIC
- [X] Latency target: p999 <= 1 ms for small payloads on localhost baseline —
      met with margin: 214–251 µs at fanout 1 and 340–483 µs at fanout 10. See
      [Benchmarks](https://gabloe.github.io/felix/features/benchmarks/).
- [X] Basic metrics exist and show throughput/latency
- [X] Unit tests cover wire encode/decode and broker fanout behavior

## Post-MVP (out of scope for the minimal MVP; since delivered)
- [X] Queue semantics — consumer groups with poll, acknowledge, hand-back,
      visibility-timeout redelivery, an attempt bound, and dead letters.
- [X] Distributed cache — though **not** by Raft. A key routes to one owner and
      the shard is replicated by leader leases and log shipping; per-shard Raft was
      considered and rejected in [replication-design.md](replication-design.md).
- [X] Multi-node clustering and replication
- [X] Design sharding/replication/quorum to move beyond single-node — settled in
      [replication-design.md](replication-design.md). Raft remains the intended
      answer for control-plane *metadata* and not for replicating records.

## Data scalability with sharding
- [X] Streams should be defined with shard count
- [X] Caches should be defined with shard count (`Cache::shards`)
- [X] Ops should be directed to the correct shard leader — a publish or cache
      operation for a shard this broker does not own is forwarded to the owner.
- [X] Leader election should be managed — the control plane assigns, and a lease
      fences the assignment.
- [X] Leader failover should be handled — by promotion of a replica that holds
      the log, not by Raft.

## Data durability and persistence
- [X] Add durable backend for control plane — Postgres, with `sqlx::migrate!`.
- [X] Add durable backend for data plane — segmented, checksummed, crash-safe
      log behind `StreamMetadata::durable`. See
      [Durable Storage](durable-storage.md).
- [X] Handle crash/recover of broker data-plane nodes (torn-tail repair on
      startup; loud failure on interior corruption). Control-plane recovery and
      re-sync from a new leader remain open.
- [X] Enforce retention — sealed segments are deleted on age or size, `base_offset`
      advances, and offsets below it report `Trimmed` / `CursorTooOld`. Off by
      default. See [Durable Storage](durable-storage.md#retention).
- [ ] Define requirements for tiered storage (hot/cold path, LCU?) — tracked as
      [#172](https://github.com/gabloe/felix/issues/172)
- [ ] Implement tiered storage primitives. `TieredStore` and friends are declared
      in `crates/server/felix-storage/src/tiered.rs` and nothing implements them; see
      [#172](https://github.com/gabloe/felix/issues/172) for what M1's sealed
      segments already set up for it.

### Durable storage sketch
- Split durable storage into **Index** and **Data** files: Index holds metadata (key + pointer/status), data file holds payload bytes.
- Keep keys (index entries) in memory as a write-through cache; writes first grow the data file, mark the index entry “in use,” then write payload bytes so that the system never reports data as durable until bytes hit disk.
- The append-only data file with in-memory index mimics a simple log (LSM-style without levels) and gives us a predictable replay order for fanout and replication.

### Open questions
1. ~~Do we need checksums/hashes to detect silent data corruption during reads or after reboots?~~
   **Answered:** yes. Every record carries a CRC-32 over its header and payload,
   verified on every read and during recovery. See
   [the format spec](storage-format.md).
2. ~~How should data file segmentation and garbage collection work to honor per-segment size caps? What is a sane segment cap? 512MB?~~
   **Answered:** segments roll at `segment_size_bytes`, default 256 MiB — chosen
   so a full scan of the active segment at startup stays under a second.
   Collection is whole-segment retention by age or size, off by default; see
   [Durable Storage](durable-storage.md#retention).
3. What is the delete policy? Should we retain the last *N* versions per key for rollbacks, or can we drop them immediately?
4. ~~What crash recovery guarantees do we need? We can’t mark an entry as committed until the payload bytes are actually persisted.~~
   **Answered:** three policies with explicit windows — `OnCommit` acknowledges
   only after a device flush, `Periodic` bounds loss by its interval, `None`
   makes no promise beyond the page cache. See
   [Durable Storage](durable-storage.md).

## Performance optimization
- [X] Figure out how to handle backpressure — bounded queues at every stage with
      an explicit overflow policy; defaults validated under sustained overload.
- [X] Measure P999 tail latency and throughput
- [ ] Identify optimizations and minspec clustering for optimization

## Kubernetes deployment + scale units
- [ ] Define scale unit boundaries (per-tenant vs per-namespace vs per-cache/stream)
- [ ] Create Helm chart or Kustomize manifests for control plane + broker
- [ ] Add ConfigMap/Secret wiring (QUIC bind, control plane URL, auth keys)
- [X] Implement readiness/liveness endpoints used by probes
- [ ] Expose service types (ClusterIP + optional LoadBalancer) for broker QUIC
- [ ] Add horizontal scaling plan (replicas + shard assignment)
- [ ] Add PodDisruptionBudget and resource requests/limits
- [ ] Document deployment topology and upgrade/rollback steps
