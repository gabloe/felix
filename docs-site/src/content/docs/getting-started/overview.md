title: "Overview"

Felix is a distributed data backend that serves three things most systems run
three products for: event streams, work queues, and a key-value cache. All
three are readings of the same replicated, append-only log, reached over one
QUIC connection.

This page is the short version of how it fits together. The
[status table](/felix/getting-started/what-felix-is-for/) is the page to trust
for what is and is not built.

## The core idea: one log, three readings

Internally there is a single primitive — an append-only log per shard. Each
external API is a different way of reading it:

- **Streams** read by offset. Every subscription keeps its own cursor, so a
  slow reader never holds anyone else back.
- **Queues** read through a cursor a consumer group shares. A record goes to
  one consumer, is redelivered if unacknowledged, and dead-lettered when it
  keeps failing.
- **Cache** reads through a key index over the same log: latest value per key,
  with TTL.

Because it is one log, there is one durability path, one recovery path, one
placement rule and one replication path. There is no cache-vs-stream
consistency bug to have, because there is no second system to disagree with
the first.

## What Felix optimizes for

Predictable latency under load, more than peak batch throughput. The choices
that follow from that:

- **QUIC as the only transport.** Streams multiplex over one connection
  without head-of-line blocking, and every connection is TLS 1.3.
- **Backpressure everywhere.** Queues are bounded and overflow policy is
  explicit, so one slow path degrades locally instead of cascading.
- **Slow-consumer isolation.** A stalled subscriber loses *its own* events
  (under the default `drop_new` policy) rather than stalling the publisher or
  other subscribers. The [slow-consumer demo](/felix/demos/slow-consumer-isolation/)
  runs both policies side by side.
- **Explicit tuning knobs.** Batching bounds, flow-control windows, pool
  sizes, and fsync policy are configuration, not magic.

Measured numbers live on the [Benchmarks](/felix/features/benchmarks/) page —
one place, so they can't drift page to page.

## The pieces

Five crates, and the boundaries between them are the design. Everything below
the dotted line is transport-independent: the broker core has no idea QUIC
exists, which is what makes it testable in-process.

- **`felix-wire`** is the protocol: a fixed frame header, JSON control
  messages, binary frames on the data plane, and capability negotiation so
  old and new peers interoperate. Full details in
  [Wire Protocol](/felix/architecture/wire-protocol/).
- **`felix-transport`** wraps QUIC: endpoints, streams, flow-control windows,
  and dedicated I/O runtimes so the transport driver is never starved by
  application tasks.
- **`felix-broker`** is the data plane with no networking in it: the log,
  subscriber registry, fanout, cache index, consumer groups.
- **`felix-client`** is the Rust SDK: publisher, subscription, and cache APIs
  over pooled connections, with reconnection and redirect-following in the
  cluster client. Python (`crates/sdk/felix-python`) and TypeScript
  (`crates/sdk/felix-typescript`) ship too, both as bindings over this client
  rather than reimplementations; Go and C# are not started.
- **The control plane** (`services/felix-controlplane-service`) holds metadata — tenants,
  namespaces, streams, caches, nodes — behind a REST API, and assigns every
  shard to a broker. Brokers watch its assignment feed. It is not on the data
  path: a publish never waits on it.

## Delivery guarantees, plainly

Configured per stream:

- **Ephemeral streams** are at-most-once. The broker acknowledges receipt,
  fans out from memory, and a subscriber that falls behind misses records.
  This is the low-latency mode, and the right one when stale data is worthless
  anyway.
- **Durable streams** are at-least-once: a record is persisted before it is
  acknowledged, and can be replayed from any retained offset. With
  `consistency: quorum`, the acknowledgement additionally waits until a
  majority of the replica set holds the record — so a failover cannot lose an
  acknowledged write.
- **Consumer groups** redeliver anything unacknowledged, count attempts, and
  park repeat failures as dead letters you can list, discard, or redrive.
- **Exactly-once is not implemented** and is not close. If duplicates are
  unacceptable, deduplicate in the application.

A lost leader is replaced by a replica that provably holds the log — about a
second on a local three-node cluster. This is tested against process kill,
graceful stop, a leader frozen past its lease, and a partitioned broker that
keeps heartbeating.

## Security

Today: TLS 1.3 on every connection, OIDC token exchange at the control plane,
tenant-scoped tokens, RBAC enforced at the broker, and mutually authenticated
broker-to-broker QUIC once `FELIX_INTERNAL_TLS_CERT`, `_KEY` and `_CA` are set.
Not yet: end-to-end payload encryption, encryption at rest, audit logging.
Details in [Security](/felix/features/security/).

## Running it

A single broker is fine for development and for workloads that fit on one
machine — durable storage and the cache work there; replication needs
somewhere to replicate to.

A cluster is brokers plus a control plane:

![Clients connect to any broker over QUIC. Brokers are peers that forward requests for shards they do not own and replicate the ones they lead. A control plane places shards by rendezvous hashing, and brokers watch its assignment feed. Inside a shard, one append-only log is read as a stream by offset and as a cache through a key index.](/felix/diagrams/architecture.svg)

The control plane keeps its metadata in one of three backends:

| Backend | What holds the metadata | When to pick it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `memory` | This process, nothing else. The default. | Development, and the harness |
| `postgres` | One external database the instances share | A platform that already runs an HA Postgres |
| `raft` | The control-plane instances themselves, replicated between them | No external database to operate — edge sites, appliances, or anywhere Postgres is a burden rather than a convenience |

Raft has shipped: the instances form a quorum and survive losing one without
losing an acknowledged write. Postgres remains fully supported; the trade
between the two, and the migration path, are in
[Metadata Raft](/felix/architecture/metadata-raft/) and
[Control-plane HA](/felix/deployment/control-plane-ha/).

Felix runs anywhere a process runs. For orchestrators it ships the pieces
they expect: readiness and liveness endpoints that answer different questions,
and a bounded graceful drain on SIGTERM — see
[Graceful shutdown](/felix/deployment/graceful-shutdown/).

## Is Felix right for your workload?

A good fit: real-time streaming with high fanout, low-latency caching,
work distribution with retries and dead letters, and services that currently
run a broker *and* a cache *and* a queue and would rather run one system.
Services that already talk Kafka can keep their producers and their
partition-assigning consumers: Felix serves the Kafka protocol for those (see
[Kafka compatibility](/felix/features/kafka/)).

A bad fit: petabyte-scale batch pipelines, complex stream processing
(joins, windowing — use Flink or Kafka Streams), or anything that needs a
mature connector ecosystem today. Kafka Connect and Kafka Streams need
consumer groups, which Felix's Kafka listener does not offer. Felix is young and its ecosystem is one
language deep.
