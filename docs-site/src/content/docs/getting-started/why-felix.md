title: "Why Felix?"
description: "Why you might run one system instead of a log, a cache and a queue — in plain language, including when you shouldn't."

Most services end up needing three things at once: a record of what happened, the
newest value for a key, and a way to hand work to whoever can do it. Felix is one
system that does all three, because all three turn out to be the same thing read
three different ways.

This page is the plain-language version. It assumes you have never read anything
else here.

## The problem: one job, three systems

Take an order service. It needs to:

- **keep a record of what happened** — order placed, paid, shipped, refunded — so
  other services can react to each event, and so you can replay the sequence later;
- **answer "what is order 42 right now?"** without walking that whole history;
- **hand out work** — send the receipt, charge the card — so that each job goes to
  exactly one worker and comes back if that worker dies.

Today that usually means three systems. Kafka or Redpanda for the record of what
happened. Redis for the current value. NATS JetStream or RabbitMQ for the work.

All three are good at their job. Kafka holds years of history and replays it.
Redis answers in microseconds and has data structures Felix does not have.
JetStream and RabbitMQ have routing and delivery features built over a decade of
people needing them. Nothing below is an argument that they are bad.

The argument is about what it costs to run all three.

![The usual arrangement: one application wired to three separate systems — an event log such as Kafka or Redpanda, a cache such as Redis, and a work queue such as NATS JetStream or RabbitMQ. Each carries its own replication, its own logins and permissions, and its own behaviour when it fails. A write travels from the application into the event log and is recorded as order 42 paid, and the same fact then has to be sent separately to the cache by the application's own glue code. A second write records order 42 as refunded in the log, but the matching write to the cache fails partway across, and the two systems are left disagreeing with nothing but the application able to notice. The closing frame counts what is being operated: three replication models, three security models, three failure models, and the glue code holding them together.](/felix/diagrams/three-stack.svg)

Three deployments to install, upgrade and patch. Three security models, so an
identity has to be granted access three times, three different ways. Three
replication models, three ways for a node to fail, and three different answers to
"is it safe to restart this one." Three sets of operational knowledge, which in
practice means three sets of habits your team has to build before anything is
routine.

And then the part nobody writes down: the glue. When an order is paid, that fact
has to reach both the log and the cache. That is two writes, and either can fail
on its own. When the second one fails, the log says refunded and the cache says
paid — and neither system is wrong from where it sits. Neither can even detect
it. Only your code knows they were supposed to agree, which means only your code
can notice, and only if you wrote that part.

## What Felix does differently

Felix stores one thing: an **append-only log**. A list of records where writes
only ever land at the end, and nothing already written is ever changed.

Stream, cache and queue are not three features built on top of that log. They are
three ways of **reading** it.

![The same application against one Felix cluster. Where the previous picture had three separate systems, there is now one box holding a single append-only log. A write travels once from the service into that log and is recorded as order 42 paid. Three readings then appear beside the same log: a stream that hands every record to everyone watching, a cache that answers with the newest value for a key, and a queue that hands records to one worker at a time until the work is finished. A second write records order 42 as refunded, and all three readings move to it together, because there is one copy of the fact and no second place to send it to. The closing frame counts what is being operated: one replication model, one security model, one failure model, and no glue code — with a note that a deployment is brokers plus a control plane, which is two kinds of process rather than one.](/felix/diagrams/one-plane.svg)

The write happens once. There is no second system to copy it into, so there is no
pair of systems that can disagree, and no glue whose job was to stop them.

## Why one log can do all three

This is the whole idea, and it is simpler than it sounds.

Picture the records in a line, oldest on the left. A new write is added on the
right. Nothing already in the line ever changes.

Now put **markers** under that line. A marker is just a position: this is the
record I am looking at.

- A **stream** is a marker that walks forward over every record, in the order they
  were written. That is all a subscriber is — a position that keeps moving right.
- A **cache** is not one marker. It is **one marker per key**, and each one sits
  on the newest record carrying its own key. Asking for the current value of
  `order-42` means following that key's marker and reading what it points at. The
  older records for that key are still in the line; the marker has just moved past
  them.
- A **queue** is a marker shared by a group of workers that only moves when
  someone says a record is finished. That is why it trails behind the stream: it
  is not measuring what has been written, it is measuring what has been done.

Two limits are worth knowing before you picture this working at scale. A
subscriber that falls too far behind has records dropped rather than buffered
for ever, and it is told that it happened — good for a live feed, wrong for
anything that must see every record without checking. And a group of workers
reads one shard: if you split a stream across several, each shard gets its own
group, and dividing the work between them is yours to arrange.

![A plain-language walkthrough of one log serving three jobs. Five records are written one after another, each landing at the end of the line and never changing afterwards. Three markers then read the same records in different ways: the stream marker walks forward across every record and ends at the newest one, the queue marker follows the same path but falls behind and stops partway because it only moves when a worker says it has finished a record, and the cache is not one marker but three — one per key — each jumping to the newest record carrying its own key. Nothing is copied anywhere; the three markers are simply three ways of pointing at the same five records.](/felix/diagrams/why-log.svg)

Same records. Three ways of pointing at them. Nothing is copied into a second
store, and no reading can disturb another — a worker finishing a job cannot move
a subscriber's position, and overwriting a key adds a record rather than
destroying one.

The precise version of this, with the test behind each claim, is
[Projections](/felix/architecture/projections/).

## What that gets you

Because the three readings share one log, they share everything underneath it.

- **One thing to deploy.** In practice that is brokers plus a control plane — two
  kinds of process, not one, and that is worth being clear about. But it is one
  system, one upgrade path, one set of release notes.
- **One security model.** Access is granted per tenant and checked at the broker,
  and the same check covers publishing, subscribing and cache operations. One
  place to reason about who can reach what.
- **One durability and replication model.** A cache shard is replicated by the
  same machinery that replicates a stream, because it is the same log. There is
  one answer to "is this write safe yet," not three.
- **One recovery story.** One way a node comes back, one way a torn write at the
  end of a file is repaired, one meaning for "this record is on disk."
- **One set of things to know.** One configuration vocabulary, one set of metrics,
  one set of failure modes to have seen before.

At 3am that is the whole point. One thing to be paged about. One dashboard. One
set of metrics that already means something to you, rather than the third system
you touch twice a year. And no class of incident that consists of two systems
quietly disagreeing about the same fact.

## When not to use Felix

Plenty of reasons, and most of them are good ones.

- **You already run Kafka in production.** It works, your team knows it, and the
  operational cost you would save is a cost you have already paid. Replacing
  working infrastructure to reduce system count is rarely worth it.
- **You need Kafka wire compatibility.** Felix speaks enough Kafka for a
  consumer that assigns its own partitions: `kcat`, a librdkafka program or a
  Java `KafkaConsumer` can read a durable Felix stream, offsets included (see
  [Reading with Kafka clients](/felix/features/kafka/)). It does not speak
  enough for the ecosystem. Kafka Connect, Streams, ksqlDB, Debezium and
  MirrorMaker all run on consumer groups, and Felix refuses groups on purpose.
  Nor does it accept writes from Kafka producers. If you need that ecosystem,
  use something that speaks the whole protocol.

  The refusal is a decision rather than a gap nobody got to. Building a group
  coordinator means building a rebalance protocol Felix deliberately does not
  have and owning its behaviour across Kafka versions. What Felix does instead
  is answer a group consumer with an error that says so, rather than leave it
  hanging in "waiting for group rebalance". The details, including what other
  Kafka-compatible systems had to build, are in
  [`docs/kafka-compatibility.md`](https://github.com/gabloe/felix/blob/main/docs/kafka-compatibility.md).
- **You need AMQP.** Exchanges, bindings, topic routing, per-message TTL, priority
  queues — the whole RabbitMQ model. Felix has none of it. A queue in Felix is a
  group of workers reading one shard, and that is the extent of it.
- **You need Redis data structures.** Felix's cache is the newest value for a key,
  with an optional expiry, plus counters. No lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes,
  streams, scripting or pub/sub channels. If you use Redis for anything beyond
  "remember this value," Felix is not a replacement for it.
- **You need long-term history.** There is no tiered or cold storage. Retention is
  bounded by the disks you give the brokers.
- **You need production mileage.** Nobody has run Felix in production. If your
  answer to "who else runs this?" has to be a name, the answer today is nobody.

The honest summary: Felix is worth considering when you are building something
new, you can see all three needs coming, and you would rather learn one system
than three. It is not worth considering as a replacement for three systems that
are already working.

## Where it stands

Felix is pre-1.0 and in active development. **It has not been run in production by
anyone**, including its author.

What exists today: multi-broker clusters, a durable log with crash recovery,
replication with leader leases and failover, a cache with expiry and counters,
consumer groups with acknowledgements and redelivery, a control plane over REST,
and tenant-scoped tokens with OIDC token exchange.

What does not exist yet:

- **Per-stream retention** — a policy can be recorded on a stream and nothing
  reads it. Retention itself works, but it is configured per broker and is off
  unless you set it, so by default a log grows until the disk does.
- **Rebalancing** — a shard whose leader is alive is never moved, however uneven
  that leaves the cluster.
- **Tiered storage, cross-region bridges, encryption at rest, and audit
  logging.**
- **Clients beyond Rust, Python and TypeScript.**
