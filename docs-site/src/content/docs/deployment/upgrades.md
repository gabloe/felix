title: Upgrades and compatibility
description: What happens when two versions of Felix meet — on the client protocol, between brokers, against the control plane, and against a broker's own disk — and the upgrade order that follows.
---

Felix has four places where two versions can meet, and they behave differently
enough that "upgrade order" has no single answer without saying which one is
meant. This page says what each one actually does on a mismatch — not what it
is intended to do.

## The four compatibility surfaces

| Surface | Between | On mismatch |
|---|---|---|
| Client protocol | client ↔ broker | Negotiated; old and new interoperate |
| Internal protocol | broker ↔ broker | Version bump is a **hard cutover**; new *kinds* are additive |
| Control-plane REST | broker ↔ control plane | Additive JSON; old and new interoperate |
| Storage format | broker ↔ its own disk | Unknown version **refuses to start**; no rollback |

### Client protocol — negotiated, so order does not matter

`felix-wire`'s frame flags are capabilities, not a version. A client offers
`Auth.client_flags`, the broker answers `AuthOk.server_flags`, and each side
uses the intersection. A peer that predates negotiation sends or receives a
plain `Ok`, which is read as `ORIGINAL_V1_FLAGS` — the three bits that existed
before negotiation, and a set that is **frozen**: adding to it would make new
clients assume support that old brokers do not have.

An unknown flag bit is *rejected*, not masked off, because a flag selects the
payload layout and ignoring one means confidently misparsing the body.

**So clients and brokers upgrade independently, in either order.** A new client
against an old broker loses the features the old broker did not advertise, and
nothing else.

`VERSION` (currently 1) exists for a change negotiation cannot express — a
header change. Bumping it would break every client at once, and nothing has
needed to.

### Internal protocol — a version bump is a cutover

`INTERNAL_VERSION` (currently 1) is checked on every frame. A peer speaking a
different one is refused, and there is **no negotiation** — no capability
exchange in `Hello`, and no way to speak an older dialect on request.

**A bump therefore requires every broker to restart together.** There is no
rolling upgrade across it, and no partial cluster. That is deliberate — the
design says the version exists for "the change that cannot cover: the header, or
an existing body layout" — but it is a maintenance window, and it should be
planned as one.

Adding a message **kind** is the additive path, and behaves differently in each
direction:

- **New broker → old broker.** The old one does not know the kind. Since the
  refusal landed it steps over the frame and answers `UnsupportedKind`, keeping
  the stream. A broker older than that change **drops the stream instead**, and
  because those streams multiplex every in-flight request to that peer, it takes
  the requests with it. They are retried; the cost is latency, not loss.
- **Old broker → new broker.** Nothing happens. An old broker never sends a kind
  it does not have.

**So during a rolling upgrade, upgrade brokers one at a time and let each settle
before the next.** A new broker will send new kinds to peers that may refuse
them, and refusal is the designed outcome; what is being waited out is the
window in which that costs a dropped stream rather than a typed answer.

### Control-plane REST — additive, and the broker tolerates absence

The broker seeds from the control plane and watches its change feed. The shapes
are serde types shared through `felix-common::membership`, and optional fields
default to the pre-existing behaviour, so a field a broker does not know is
ignored and one the control plane does not send takes its default.

**Upgrade the control plane first.** A new broker may report fields an old
control plane drops — the reports still land, minus the new information — while
an old broker against a new control plane simply does not use what it cannot
see. Neither direction fails, so the order is a preference rather than a
requirement.

### Storage format — the one that does not roll back

`FORMAT_VERSION` (currently 2) is in every segment header, and a version that
does not match is a `Corruption`, not a warning. **A broker will not open a log
written by a newer build.**

That makes a storage format bump irreversible without restoring from backup: a
broker that has written one segment at the new version cannot be rolled back to
the old build, because the old build refuses to read its own data directory.

Two things soften it, and neither is a rollback path:

- **Indexes are derived.** A `.index` file whose version does not match is
  rebuilt from the segment it describes, so the index format can change freely.
- **The generation history is derived too.** An `epochs` file that is absent,
  short, or fails its checksum reads as empty rather than failing, which costs
  automatic divergence repair and never a record.

**So before an upgrade that changes `FORMAT_VERSION`: take a backup, and treat
the rollout as one-way.** Nothing in the current release does; this is the rule
for when one does.

## Upgrade order

For a release that changes none of the versions above — the ordinary case:

1. **Control plane**, instance by instance. Readiness takes an instance out of
   rotation while it restarts, and brokers serve from the catalog they already
   hold while it is away. Under the Raft backend, restarting the *leader* pauses
   metadata writes for one election (about 1.2s).
2. **Brokers**, one at a time, waiting for each to report ready and for its
   shards to be back in their replica sets before the next. `GET
   /replication/halted` on the metrics port should be empty before continuing —
   a replica that halted during the previous restart is one that will not be
   there for the next.
3. **Clients**, whenever. The protocol negotiates.

If the release changes `INTERNAL_VERSION`, step 2 is not rolling: stop every
broker, upgrade, start every broker.

If it changes `FORMAT_VERSION`, back up first and do not plan to roll back.

## Rollback

| Changed | Rollback |
|---|---|
| Nothing versioned | Reverse the order above |
| Client protocol capability | Safe; clients lose the feature |
| Internal protocol *kind* | Safe once every broker is back on the old build; see the note on credentialed forwards below |
| `INTERNAL_VERSION` | Cutover again, in both directions |
| `FORMAT_VERSION` | **Not possible.** Restore from backup |

## What this does not cover

Topology, install steps and replacing a persistent volume are on
[Kubernetes Deployment](/felix/deployment/kubernetes/). Adding, draining and
removing a broker have their own page:
[Adding, draining and removing brokers](/felix/deployment/scaling/).

The two observable checks available during any upgrade:

```bash
# Which replicas replication has stopped for. Empty before you continue.
curl -s http://broker:8080/replication/halted | jq

# What a broker would actually run with, without starting it.
felix-broker --print-config
```

See [Observability](/felix/features/observability/) for what to watch while a
rollout is in progress.

### A note on credentialed forwards

Forwarded publishes and cache operations carry the client's credential on
kinds of their own, and an upgraded owner refuses the credential-less legacy
kinds — that refusal is the fix, not a side effect. During a rolling broker
upgrade the two builds meet in both directions, and they behave differently:

- **Upgraded broker forwarding to an old owner.** The old owner answers
  `UnsupportedKind`; the forwarder sends the legacy kind once instead, and the
  publish goes through. That owner checks nothing either way, so nothing is
  lost that the upgrade had gained.
- **Old broker forwarding to an upgraded owner.** Refused `Unauthorized`, and
  the client's publish fails, until that broker is upgraded too.

So the window is bounded by how long un-upgraded brokers keep forwarding to
upgraded ones: upgrade brokers quickly and in one pass, and expect publishes
that cross the boundary in that direction to fail with `Unauthorized` while it
is open. Rolling back closes it the same way in reverse.
