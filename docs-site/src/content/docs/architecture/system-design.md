title: "System Design"
---

How the whole system fits together: the design goals, the pieces, and the paths a publish, a subscribe, and a cache request take through them.

## Design Principles

### 1. One Core Log, Many Semantics

Internally, Felix is built around a single append-only log abstraction. Different external semantics are projections over this core:

- **Streams (Pub/Sub):** read the log forward, one cursor per subscription
- **Caches:** read the log through an index of key to latest offset, rebuilt from the log itself
- **Queues:** read the log through a cursor shared by a consumer group, with acknowledgements and bounded redelivery

All three are built. What each one stores, keeps in memory, and rebuilds from the log — and the test behind every claim about them — is in [Projections](/felix/architecture/projections/), which is the page to trust when this one is vaguer.

This reduces operational complexity and consistency bugs compared to running Kafka, Redis, and a queueing system side-by-side. It is also the project's central bet, so the claim is held to its evidence rather than repeated: `scripts/check_doc_evidence.py` fails the docs build if a cited test no longer exists.

### 2. Low-Latency First

Felix prioritizes predictable low latency over maximum batch throughput:

- **QUIC transport:** Multiplexed, encrypted, congestion-aware
- **Optional ephemeral streams:** No disk on hot path
- **Aggressive backpressure:** Bounded memory everywhere
- **Leader-based writes:** Tunable acknowledgement policies

### 3. Kubernetes-Native

Felix assumes Kubernetes for process lifecycle, identity (ServiceAccounts), networking and service discovery, and failure detection. Felix does **not** attempt to reimplement scheduling or node membership logic that Kubernetes already provides.

## System Architecture

![Clients connect to any broker over QUIC. Brokers are peers that forward requests for shards they do not own and replicate the ones they lead. A control plane places shards by rendezvous hashing, and brokers watch its assignment feed. Inside a shard, one append-only log is read as a stream by offset and as a cache through a key index.](/felix/diagrams/architecture.svg)

Three things carry most of the design.

**Any broker accepts any request.** A client connects to whichever broker it can reach and asks it for the topology. If that broker does not lead the shard the request belongs to, it forwards the request to the broker that does and relays the answer — the client is never asked to find the right one first, and never talks to more than one broker for a single request.

**Ownership comes from the control plane, and only from there.** Every shard of every stream and cache has exactly one leader, chosen by rendezvous hashing over the live nodes. Brokers watch the assignment feed — a snapshot, then a change stream — and never negotiate ownership among themselves.

**No consensus protocol runs between brokers.** Placement is a pure function of a metadata snapshot, so two control-plane instances reading the same catalog reach the same answer without having to agree on one. Durability across a leader change comes from log shipping and leader leases: per-shard Raft was considered and rejected, for reasons set out in [`docs/replication-design.md`](https://github.com/gabloe/felix/blob/main/docs/replication-design.md).

That rejection is specific to *replicating records*. Making the control plane's own metadata highly available is a separate problem, and Raft remains the intended answer there — it is not implemented yet, and until it is, control-plane availability rests on Postgres.

The control plane is not on the data path. A publish, a subscribe, or a cache operation never calls it; brokers read it in the background and serve from what they already hold.

### Control plane

Serves metadata over REST, backed by a Raft group across the instances, by
Postgres, or by an in-memory store. It owns tenants, namespaces, streams, caches, the node catalog, and shard assignments, and it runs placement on a timer. Brokers seed from it at startup and gate readiness on that seeding, so a broker does not accept traffic for streams it does not yet know about.

### Data plane

Brokers serve clients over QUIC and reach each other over a separate QUIC endpoint with its own protocol. Each one leads some shards, replicates the ones it leads to followers, forwards what it does not lead, and refuses what it cannot route — a request served locally by a broker that does not own it is exactly the divergence the ownership check exists to prevent.


## Data Flow Patterns

### Publish/Subscribe Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant P as Publisher
    participant B as Broker
    participant S1 as Subscriber 1
    participant S2 as Subscriber 2
    
    P->>B: Open control stream (QUIC bi)
    S1->>B: Open control stream (QUIC bi)
    S2->>B: Open control stream (QUIC bi)
    
    S1->>B: Subscribe(tenant, namespace, stream)
    B-->>S1: OK
    B->>S1: Open event stream (QUIC uni)
    
    S2->>B: Subscribe(tenant, namespace, stream)
    B-->>S2: OK
    B->>S2: Open event stream (QUIC uni)
    
    loop Publishing
        P->>B: Publish(batch of messages)
        B-->>P: ACK (optional)
        B->>B: Enqueue for fanout
        par Fanout to subscribers
            B->>S1: Event batch
            B->>S2: Event batch
        end
    end
```

**Key characteristics:**

- Publishers use bidirectional control streams for publish requests
- Subscribers get dedicated unidirectional event streams
- Fanout happens independently per subscriber (isolation)
- Batching is time and count-bounded for throughput optimization

### Cache Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant B as Broker
    
    C->>B: Open cache stream pool (N connections)
    Note over C,B: M stream workers per connection
    
    par Concurrent requests
        C->>B: cache_put(tenant, namespace, cache, key1, value1, ttl)
        C->>B: cache_get(tenant, namespace, cache, key2)
        C->>B: cache_put(tenant, namespace, cache, key3, value3, ttl)
    end
    
    par Concurrent responses
        B-->>C: OK (key1)
        B-->>C: cache_value(key2, null)
        B-->>C: OK (key3)
    end
```

**Key characteristics:**

- Connection pooling reduces handshake overhead
- Request multiplexing over long-lived streams
- Request IDs for request/response matching
- Sub-millisecond latency at moderate concurrency

### Cross-Broker Routing

When a client reaches a broker that does not lead the target shard:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant B1 as Broker (ingress)
    participant B2 as Broker (shard owner)

    C->>B1: Publish(stream, key, batch)
    B1->>B1: hash the key, resolve the owner locally
    B1->>B2: ForwardPublish(shard, generation, payloads)
    B2->>B2: check ownership at that generation, then commit
    B2-->>B1: ForwardPublishOk(offsets)
    B1-->>C: Ack
```

**The control plane is not in this picture, and that is the point.** Resolving an
owner is an atomic load of a routing snapshot the broker already holds — no lock,
no network call — because this is the hottest question the broker is asked. The
snapshot is refreshed in the background from the assignment feed.

The `generation` the ingress broker resolved against travels with the request.
The owner compares it against its own and answers a mismatch explicitly in either
direction, so a stale view is a typed answer rather than a write to a shard
somebody has already been given.

## Storage Architecture

Storage is selected per stream. A stream registered with `durable: false` — the
default — behaves exactly as it always has; `durable: true` writes every publish
to disk before it is fanned out or acknowledged.

### Ephemeral (default)

- **In-memory only:** No disk writes on hot path
- **Bounded buffers:** Ring buffers with fixed capacity
- **TTL support:** Lazy expiration on access
- **No persistence:** Data lost on restart

**Use cases:**

- Ultra-low latency workloads
- Development and testing
- Temporary caching
- Non-critical event streams

### Durable (`durable: true`)

- **Segmented append-only log:** versioned, checksummed segments per stream
  shard, with sparse offset indexes. Not write-ahead logging — the log *is* the
  data, not a journal protecting another structure.
- **Configurable fsync:** `none`, `periodic { interval }`, or `on_commit`, which
  acknowledges only after the record is on the device
- **Crash recovery:** a provably incomplete tail is repaired; anything else
  fails startup loudly rather than discarding acknowledged records
- **Historical replay:** paged reads from disk by offset

Retention is implemented and off by default: set
`FELIX_DURABLE_RETENTION_BYTES` or `FELIX_DURABLE_RETENTION_SECONDS` and the
oldest segments are discarded, with a resume below the oldest retained offset
answered by a typed error rather than a silent restart at the tail. Unset,
nothing deletes segments and a log grows without bound.

Not yet implemented: **snapshots**, and **tiered storage**
([#172](https://github.com/gabloe/felix/issues/172)). Compaction exists, but for
the cache rather than for streams — a cache log reclaims superseded and expired
records, and a stream log never rewrites a record at all.

See [Durable Storage](/felix/architecture/durable-storage/).

**Use cases:**

- Production event streaming
- Critical message delivery
- Replay and audit trails

## Consistency Model

### Single node

- **Delivery:** At-most-once for a plain subscription; at-least-once through a
  consumer group, which redelivers anything not acknowledged before its
  visibility timeout
- **Ordering:** Per-stream ordering preserved per subscriber. For a durable
  stream, the order on disk is authoritative and cursor replay and live
  delivery both follow it.
- **Durability:** Per stream. Ephemeral by default; `durable: true` persists
  every publish before acknowledging it.

### Clustered

Consistency is declared per stream:

- **`Leader`:** the leader acknowledges once the record is durable locally. Lowest
  latency, and the default.
- **`Quorum`:** the leader waits until a majority of the shard's replicas — itself
  included — hold the record. A record acknowledged this way survives the loss of
  its leader.

A leader serves only while it holds a lease on the shards it leads, so a broker
that has been superseded stops acknowledging rather than discovering the fact
later.

![A lease on one time axis. Broker A may accept writes only until its lease expiry minus epsilon, by its own monotonic clock. The control plane may not grant the next generation to another broker until the expiry plus a margin. The gap between them is a safety interval in which no broker is leader. Below, a write admitted while the lease was valid is delayed past expiry, and the commit-time re-check refuses it.](/felix/diagrams/leader-lease.svg)

The leader stops **ε early** by its own clock; the control plane waits out a
**margin** on top of the full lease before handing the shard to anyone else. The
gap between those two instants is a safety interval in which no broker believes
it is leader, and it is why this works without the two clocks ever agreeing —
each only has to measure its own elapsed time.

The lease is checked twice, on admission and again immediately before the record
is committed. The second check is not redundant: a full ingress queue, a slow
fsync or a stopped VM can take arbitrarily long, and a lease that was valid when
the request arrived may have expired by the time the bytes reach the disk. On failover, only a replica that actually holds the log is promoted: a
shard whose leader is gone and whose replicas are behind is left unavailable
rather than reopened empty, because a silently empty shard *is* the data loss.

**Delivery guarantees:**

- **At-most-once:** a plain subscription, best-effort with no retries
- **At-least-once:** a consumer group, which redelivers until acknowledged and
  then dead-letters; or a durable stream replayed from a checkpointed offset
- **Exactly-once:** not implemented, and not planned — see
  [Semantics](/felix/architecture/semantics/)

## Multi-Region Architecture (Planned)

:::caution[Not yet implemented]
Everything in this section describes a target design, not current
behavior. `felix-router` today is a simple allowlist of permitted
region pairs; there is no encryption-boundary enforcement, audit
logging, or metadata-level isolation wired into the broker yet, and no
compliance claim should be inferred until this actually lands.
:::
The target design has Felix enforce regional isolation with explicit bridges:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Region1["Region: US-EAST"]
        B1["Brokers<br/>US-EAST"]
        CONTROLPLANE1["Control Plane<br/>US-EAST"]
    end
    
    subgraph Region2["Region: EU-WEST"]
        B2["Brokers<br/>EU-WEST"]
        CONTROLPLANE2["Control Plane<br/>EU-WEST"]
    end
    
    subgraph Bridge["Explicit Bridge"]
        BridgeAgent["Bridge Agent<br/>• Allowlist<br/>• Encryption<br/>• Audit Log"]
    end
    
    B1 <-->|"Explicit config only"| BridgeAgent
    BridgeAgent <-->|"Explicit config only"| B2
    
    style Region1 fill:#e1f5ff,stroke:#334155,color:#111827
    style Region2 fill:#fff4e1,stroke:#334155,color:#111827
    style Bridge fill:#ffe1e1,stroke:#334155,color:#111827
```

**Target bridge characteristics (not yet built):**

- **Explicit Configuration:** No implicit data movement
- **Stream Allowlist:** Only specified streams replicate
- **Independent Encryption:** Per-region key contexts
- **Audit Trail:** Complete log of cross-region data movement

None of this has been implemented or audited; do not rely on it for
regulatory or compliance purposes until it ships.

## Scalability Considerations

### Vertical Scaling (Single-Node)

- **CPU:** More cores for parallel stream processing
- **Memory:** Larger buffers and cache capacity
- **Network:** Higher bandwidth for fanout
- **Measured:** hundreds of thousands to millions of msg/s on a single node,
  depending entirely on payload size and fanout — see
  [Benchmarks](/felix/features/benchmarks/) rather than any single figure here

### Horizontal Scaling (Multi-Node)

- **Sharding:** Partition streams across brokers
- **Connection pooling:** Reuse connections across shards
- **Control plane:** REST over Raft, Postgres, or memory; scale by adding
  instances, since placement is a pure function of the catalog and needs no
  agreement between them. On the Postgres backend the instances are stateless;
  on the Raft backend they hold the metadata themselves
- **Data plane:** many broker nodes for capacity

No cluster-level throughput figure is claimed here: the published benchmarks are
single-node, and a multi-node number measured on one machine would say more
about the loopback than about Felix.
