title: "TypeScript Client"
description: "Installing and using the Felix Node.js client: promises, typed errors, disposal, streams, queues, cache watches, multi-shard consumption, and the failure modes worth writing code for."
---

`felix-client` on npm is a napi-rs addon over the Rust crate of the same name,
not a reimplementation. Reconnection, redirect-following, retry classification
and offset bookkeeping live in the crate and are shared; Node gets the same
failover behaviour Rust does rather than its own approximation. The name is
deliberately identical on crates.io, PyPI and npm. See
[Choosing a Client](/felix/clients/overview/) for why that choice was made.

## Installing

```bash
npm install felix-client
```

The binary ships as one package per platform, declared as optional
dependencies, so npm fetches only the one your machine needs — nothing is
compiled at install time and no Rust toolchain is required. Linux (x86-64 and
arm64, glibc), macOS (Intel and Apple silicon) and Windows x86-64 are covered.

To build it from the repository instead:

```bash
cd crates/felix-typescript
napi build --platform --release      # needs: npm i -g @napi-rs/cli@2
```

Without the napi CLI, `napi build` is mostly a rename — a plain `cargo build`
produces a loadable addon and the package finds it:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

Requires Node 18 or newer.

## One surface, and it is asynchronous

Python offers two surfaces because its synchronous one is the older idiom. Node
has no such split: blocking the event loop is not something a library may do,
so **every call returns a `Promise`**. napi-rs runs the future on its own Tokio
runtime and settles the promise from there, which keeps the event loop free
while a publish is in flight.

```ts
import { Client } from "felix-client";

const client = await Client.connect("127.0.0.1:5000", "t1", token, "localhost", caFile);
await client.publish("t1", "default", "events", Buffer.from("hello"));
client.close();
```

## Connecting

```ts
Client.connect(
  addrs,        // "host:port", or an array of them
  tenantId,
  token,
  serverName,   // the name the broker's certificate carries; defaults to "localhost"
  caFile,       // trust a specific CA; omit for the system trust store
)
```

One reachable address is enough — the client discovers the rest of the cluster
and will use brokers it was never told about. Passing several only helps the
*first* connection.

**TLS is not optional.** QUIC has no unencrypted mode, so there are two trust
choices and no third: the platform trust store, or an explicit `caFile` for a
self-signed development broker. There is deliberately no "skip verification"
switch.

## Disposal

Every handle has an idempotent `close()` and implements `Symbol.asyncDispose`,
so on Node 24 and newer a `throw` releases it on the way out:

```ts
await using events = await client.subscribe("t1", "default", "events");
```

The package itself asks only for Node 18 — `await using` is the syntax that
needs the newer runtime, not the disposal. On older Node, call `close()` in a
`finally`.

**`close()` cancels a read in flight rather than waiting for it.** A consumer
shutting down is almost always parked on `nextEvent`, and waiting for the read
it is cancelling would hang exactly the path that needs to make progress.

## Publishing

```ts
await client.publish("t1", "default", "orders", payload);                          // acked
await client.publish("t1", "default", "orders", payload, undefined, "none");       // fire and forget
await client.publish("t1", "default", "orders", payload, Buffer.from(customerId)); // routed
```

Arguments are positional: `(tenantId, namespace, stream, payload, key?, ack?,
atLeastOnce?)`. Pass `undefined` to skip one.

### The routing key decides the shard

**Without a key every record lands on shard 0**, so a multi-shard stream
behaves like a single-shard one. If you created a stream with several shards to
get throughput and are not passing a key, you are not getting it.

```ts
for (const order of orders) {
  await client.publish(
    "t1", "default", "orders",
    Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(order)),
    Buffer.from(order.customerId),
  );
}
```

Records sharing a key share a shard and stay ordered with respect to each
other; records with different keys do not, once a stream has more than one
shard.

### At-least-once duplicates, and says so

By default a publish whose outcome was ambiguous is **reported, not re-sent** —
nothing downstream can tell two copies apart.

```ts
await client.publish("t1", "default", "orders", payload, undefined, "per_message", true);
```

The record is then certain to land and **may land twice**. It cannot be
combined with a key: the re-send path does not carry one, so the combination is
refused rather than silently resolved.

## Subscribing

```ts
const events = await client.subscribe("t1", "default", "events");
try {
  for (;;) {
    const event = await events.nextEvent();
    if (event === null) break;          // the subscription ended
    handle(event.payload);
  }
} finally {
  await events.close();
}
```

`start` is `"latest"` (the default), `"earliest"`, or a `bigint` offset — **the
first record you have not seen**, so a resuming consumer passes the offset it
last handled *plus one*. Offsets are `bigint`, so the arithmetic is `+ 1n`.

:::caution[Do not abandon a `nextEvent` you raced against a timer]
There is no timeout argument, because a caller who wants one can race the
promise. But the losing `nextEvent` **stays in flight and will resolve with the
next record** — so keep the promise and await it again rather than calling
`nextEvent` afresh, or you will drop the record it was about to hand you.

```ts
let pending = null;
async function next(timeoutMs) {
  pending ??= events.nextEvent();
  const item = await Promise.race([pending, timer(timeoutMs)]);
  if (item === TIMED_OUT) return null;   // pending is kept for next time
  pending = null;
  return item;
}
```
:::

### Offsets are how you notice a drop

Subscriber queues shed under the default policy rather than blocking the
publisher, so a subscriber can silently miss records. On a durable stream every
event carries its log offset, and **a jump in them is exactly a drop**:

```ts
let expected = null;
for (;;) {
  const event = await events.nextEvent();
  if (event === null) break;
  if (expected !== null && event.offset !== expected) {
    console.warn(`dropped ${event.offset - expected} records`);
  }
  expected = event.offset + 1n;
  handle(event.payload);
}
```

### A consumer that survives a restart

```ts
async function run(client, checkpoint) {
  let start = await checkpoint.load();           // null on a cold start
  start = start === null ? "earliest" : start + 1n;

  for (;;) {
    const events = await client.subscribe("t1", "default", "events", start);
    try {
      for (;;) {
        const event = await events.nextEvent();
        if (event === null) break;
        await handle(event.payload);
        await checkpoint.save(event.offset);
        start = event.offset + 1n;
      }
    } catch (err) {
      if (err instanceof ConnectionError) {
        await sleep(1000);                       // retryable; resume from `start`
      } else if (err instanceof CursorError) {
        // Retention discarded the offset. Accept the gap and say so — silently
        // restarting at the tail would lose records without telling anyone.
        console.error(`checkpoint ${start} is past retention; restarting at earliest`);
        start = "earliest";
      } else {
        throw err;
      }
    } finally {
      await events.close();
    }
  }
}
```

## Errors you can act on

```ts
import { ConnectionError, AuthError, NotFoundError, CursorError } from "felix-client";

try {
  await client.publish("t1", "default", "orders", payload);
} catch (err) {
  if (err instanceof ConnectionError) retry();          // err.retryable === true
  else if (err instanceof AuthError) giveUp();          // retrying grants no permission
  else if (err instanceof NotFoundError) createStream();
  else throw err;
}
```

| Class | What it means | `retryable` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ConnectionError` | broker unreachable, or the connection died mid-call | `true` |
| `AuthError` | token rejected, or missing the permission | `false` |
| `NotFoundError` | no such tenant, namespace, stream or cache | `false` |
| `CursorError` | the start offset is gone; retention discarded it | `false` |
| `InvalidArgumentError` | a bad argument to this client | `false` |
| `FelixError` | the base, and anything unclassified | `false` |

Each also carries a stable `err.code` (`FELIX_CONNECTION`, `FELIX_AUTH`, …) for
code that would rather switch than test `instanceof`. Never match on the
message — it is prose and will be reworded.

## Queues

Records are **pulled**, because only the consumer knows when it has capacity;
each is claimed by one member until settled; an unsettled record comes back.

```ts
for (;;) {
  const records = await client.groupPoll(
    "t1", "default", "orders", shard, "billing",
    32,        // maxRecords
    5000,      // waitMs — a long poll; an empty array is an answer, not an error
  );

  for (const record of records) {
    try {
      await charge(record.payload);
      await client.groupAck("t1", "default", "orders", shard, "billing", record.offset);
    } catch {
      // Back to the queue now, rather than after the visibility timeout.
      await client.groupNack("t1", "default", "orders", shard, "billing", record.offset);
    }
  }
}
```

`record.attempts` counts deliveries **including this one**, so `1` is a first
attempt and anything higher is a redelivery — worth branching on before doing
anything expensive or side-effecting:

```ts
if (record.attempts > 3) {
  await quarantine(record);
  await client.groupAck(...);     // settle it; it is not coming back
}
```

**A group is bound to one shard.** Consuming a multi-shard stream means polling
each shard's group — `streamShards` says how many there are.

### Dead letters

```ts
const offsets = await client.groupDeadLetters("t1", "default", "orders", shard, "billing");
for (const offset of offsets) {
  if (fixedTheCause) {
    await client.groupRedrive("t1", "default", "orders", shard, "billing", offset);
  } else {
    await client.groupDiscard("t1", "default", "orders", shard, "billing", offset);
  }
}
```

## Cache watches

What makes the cache a state-synchronisation primitive rather than a
notification: resume by offset, and loss that is loud.

```ts
const watch = await client.watchCache(
  "t1", "default", "sessions",
  undefined,        // key — or a prefix, below
  "room:42:",       // prefix
  undefined,        // start offset
  true,             // retained
);

const roster = new Map();
try {
  // Retained values arrive first, and the count says exactly how many. 0n is a
  // definite answer — the prefix is empty — not a silence to wait through.
  for (let i = 0n; i < watch.retainedCount; i++) {
    const { change } = await watch.recv();
    roster.set(change.key, change.value);
  }

  // State is now complete. Everything after this is live.
  for (;;) {
    const item = await watch.recv();
    if (item === null) break;
    if (item.laggedResumeFrom !== null) {
      // Not an error: the watch did its job by saying so. Offsets on a filtered
      // watch are sparse, so loss cannot be inferred the way a stream
      // subscriber infers it — this is the only signal.
      return resumeFrom(item.laggedResumeFrom);
    }
    if (item.change.value === null) {
      roster.delete(item.change.key);   // a delete is a change with no value
    } else {
      roster.set(item.change.key, item.change.value);
    }
  }
} finally {
  await watch.close();
}
```

Three things there are load-bearing:

- **`retainedCount`** tells you the moment your state is complete.
- **`value === null` means removed**, deliberately distinguishable from an empty
  value. A watcher mirroring a cache has to tell those apart.
- **`laggedResumeFrom` is a value, not a rejection.** Re-watching from it is
  gapless.

`start` and `retained` are mutually exclusive — a resume already replays the
state a retained start shortcuts, so asking for both is refused rather than
resolved. A prefix watch reads **one shard**.

## Multi-shard streams

A subscription reads one shard. `subscribeSharded` opens one per shard, follows
each shard's own owner, and merges them:

```ts
const stream = await client.subscribeSharded("t1", "default", "orders");
console.log(`${stream.shards} shards`);

for (;;) {
  const item = await stream.nextEvent();
  if (item === null) break;
  if (item.event) {
    handle(item.event.payload);
  } else if (item.lostError) {
    // Surfaced rather than swallowed: the other shards carry on, so a consumer
    // that ignored this would be reading part of the stream while believing it
    // read all of it.
    alert(item.shard, item.lostError);
  } else if (item.recovered) {
    console.log(`shard ${item.shard} back`);
  }
}
```

Resuming is a **map**, not a number, because offsets are per shard:

```ts
const positions = await stream.positions();   // { "0": 41n, "1": 12n, ... }
// ... later, after a restart
const resumed = await client.subscribeSharded(
  "t1", "default", "orders", undefined, positions,
);
```

A single offset carried across shards would replay on every shard but one.

:::caution[A shard that delivered nothing has no position]
`positions()` only lists shards that handed something over. On resume, a shard
not in the map starts wherever `start` says — the live tail by default — so
records published to it while you were away are missed. Pass
`start: "earliest"` alongside `resume` if that matters, or make sure every
shard has reported before you checkpoint.
:::

## Buffers are Buffers

Payloads and cache values come back as real `Buffer`s, not wrappers. `equals`,
`toString`, `Buffer.concat` and `deepStrictEqual` all behave:

```ts
if (event.payload.equals(expected)) { /* ... */ }
```

Offsets, counters and cache-watch offsets are `bigint`. Mixing them with
`number` throws, so `offset + 1n` rather than `offset + 1`.

## What is not wrapped

- **Idempotent producers** (`producerInit` / `publishIdempotent`) — they turn an
  ambiguous publish into one the broker recognises as a re-send and refuses to
  append twice. Surface over a primitive that already exists, not protocol
  work.

Marked in the conformance catalogue, so the binding reports it as unclaimed
rather than passing over it in silence.

## Conformance

TypeScript passes every required scenario in the
[client conformance catalogue](/felix/clients/overview/#the-conformance-suite),
and CI and the release pipeline are both gated on it. The suite runs against a
real three-node cluster — a redirect needs a broker that does not own the
shard, and one scenario kills the broker its client is connected to.

```bash
task ts:conformance    # build what it needs, run it, check the verdict
```
