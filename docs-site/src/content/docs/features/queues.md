title: "Queues and Consumer Groups"
description: "Distribute work across consumers with acknowledgements, redelivery, and dead letters."

A **consumer group** reads a stream as work rather than as a broadcast. Where
every subscriber to a stream sees every record, the members of a group divide
the records between them: one consumer holds a record at a time, and the record
is not finished until someone says so.

It is the same log underneath — see
[Projections](/felix/architecture/projections/) — read through a cursor the
group shares instead of a cursor per subscriber.

## The loop

```rust
loop {
    // Wait up to five seconds for work rather than spinning.
    let batch = client
        .group_poll_wait("t1", "default", "jobs", 0, "workers", 16, Duration::from_secs(5))
        .await?;

    for record in batch {
        match handle(&record.payload).await {
            Ok(()) => {
                client.group_ack("t1", "default", "jobs", 0, "workers", record.offset).await?;
            }
            Err(_) => {
                // Hand it back now rather than waiting out the timeout.
                client.group_nack("t1", "default", "jobs", 0, "workers", record.offset).await?;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

An empty batch means nothing was available, not an error.

## What the broker guarantees

**A record is held by one consumer at a time.** While a claim stands, no other
poll receives that record.

**A claim expires.** A consumer that stops answering does not hold a record for
ever: after `FELIX_GROUP_VISIBILITY_TIMEOUT_MS` the record is owed again and
goes to whoever polls next. This is why the loop above must be able to see the
same record twice.

**The cursor moves only over a contiguous run of acknowledgements.** If you
finish offset 6 while 5 is still outstanding, the group's saved position stays
below 5. Acknowledging out of order is fine; the position simply waits.

**Owed records go out before new ones**, so a redelivery is not starved behind a
fast producer.

> `owed_records_go_out_before_new_ones`.

## Retries and giving up

Every delivery carries `attempts`, counting this one. `1` is a first attempt;
anything higher is a redelivery, so a consumer can behave differently on a
retry — log it, route it elsewhere, or give up early.

After `FELIX_GROUP_MAX_ATTEMPTS` deliveries the broker gives up on a record: the
offset is recorded as a **dead letter** and the group moves past it. Without
that bound, one record that always fails stops the queue at that offset for
ever.

```rust
let dead = client.group_dead_letters("t1", "default", "jobs", 0, "workers").await?;
for offset in dead {
    // The record is still in the log at this offset.
    // Fixed the bug? Put it back:
    client.group_redrive("t1", "default", "jobs", 0, "workers", offset).await?;
    // Genuinely unprocessable? Stop tracking it:
    // client.group_discard("t1", "default", "jobs", 0, "workers", offset).await?;
}
```

**A dead letter is a pointer, not a copy.** The record stays in the stream's log
at that offset, readable by an ordinary replay. Nothing is duplicated, and
nothing is moved somewhere you have to go and find.

A redrive resets the record's attempt count and makes it owed again. It does
**not** move the group's cursor backwards, so everything already finished stays
finished.

> `a_redriven_record_is_handed_out_again`,
> `a_redriven_record_gets_its_attempts_back`.

## What a queue does not promise

**Order.** A shared cursor gives it up the moment two consumers hold adjacent
records, and a redelivery reorders regardless of how many consumers there are. A
queue preserves the order records are *handed out* in and says nothing about the
order they are finished in. If you need per-key ordering, use a stream with a
routing key so related records land on one shard.

**Exactly-once.** A record can arrive twice — after a claim lapses, after a
leader is lost, or after a redrive. Handlers must tolerate seeing the same
record again.

**A consumer per group member.** A group is bound to the shard you name, and
nothing assigns shards across a group's consumers. Running one consumer per
shard is the application's job today; there is no coordinator handing shards
out.

**Survival of a leader failover.** The group's position lives on the broker
leading the shard and is not replicated. If that broker is lost, the promoted
replica starts the group from the beginning and redelivers everything.
Technically within at-least-once, and severe — tracked as
[#314](https://github.com/gabloe/felix/issues/314).

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | What it controls |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FELIX_GROUP_VISIBILITY_TIMEOUT_MS` | `30000` | How long a claim stands before the record is owed again. Too short redelivers work still being done; too long leaves a dead consumer's records stuck. |
| `FELIX_GROUP_MAX_ATTEMPTS` | `5` | Deliveries before a record is dead-lettered. |
| `FELIX_GROUP_MAX_WAIT_MS` | `30000` | Cap on how long a polling client may ask the broker to wait. |

Groups need durable storage: without `FELIX_DURABLE_STORAGE_DIR` the broker does
not advertise the feature at all, because a position lost on every restart would
redeliver everything each time.
