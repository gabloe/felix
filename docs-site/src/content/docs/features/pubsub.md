title: "Publish/Subscribe"
---

The model is small: publishers send to a **stream**, every subscriber to that
stream receives what lands on it, and streams are scoped by
`(tenant, namespace, stream)`. What this page is really about is the two
properties the implementation works hardest for — cheap fanout, and the
guarantee that one slow subscriber cannot hurt anyone else.

## Fanout

A publish is encoded **once** and the encoded frame is shared by every
subscriber, so adding subscribers adds delivery work but not re-encoding
work. Measured latency at fanout 1 and 10 (macOS loopback, per-message ack,
median of 5–10 trials):

| Fanout | p50 | p99 |
|--------|-----|-----|
| 1 | 109–136 µs | 138–176 µs |
| 10 | 236–269 µs | 278–399 µs |

Fanout above 10 has not been benchmarked; see
[Benchmarks](/felix/features/benchmarks/) for methodology and the full tables.
Treat behaviour at hundreds or thousands of subscribers as unmeasured.

## Batching

### Publisher side

Send several payloads in one request:

```rust
use felix_wire::AckMode;

let mut batch = Vec::new();
for i in 0..64 {
    batch.push(format!("Event {}", i).into_bytes());
}

let publisher = client.publisher().await?;
publisher
    .publish_batch("tenant", "ns", "stream", batch, AckMode::PerBatch)
    .await?;
```

Batching amortizes per-request overhead (framing, syscalls, one ack for the
whole batch), and it is the single biggest throughput lever on the publish
path. Measured batch throughput is in
[Benchmarks](/felix/features/benchmarks/) — and note that a batched run
measures a throughput profile, not request latency.

### Acked publishes are pipelined

Acked publishes (`AckMode::PerMessage` / `AckMode::PerBatch`) do not stall
the stream for the broker's round trip. The client writes acked requests back
to back and resolves each caller's future as the matching ack arrives, in
order — so concurrent publishers on the same stream share the stream's full
bandwidth instead of taking turns paying a round trip each. In-flight acked
data is bounded by the publisher's byte budget (`publish_inflight_bytes`,
4 MiB by default): a request holds its budget until the broker's ack, not
merely until the frame is written.

A single caller that awaits each publish before issuing the next still
experiences one round trip per publish, by construction — batch, or publish
concurrently, to amortize it.

### Broker side

The broker coalesces events into delivery batches per subscription. A batch
flushes when **any** bound is hit:

```yaml
event_batch_max_events: 64      # this many events, or
event_batch_max_bytes: 262144   # this many bytes, or
event_batch_max_delay_us: 250   # this much time since the first event
```

Small events under a steady load flush on the count bound; big events flush
on bytes; a trickle flushes on the delay, which is therefore the latency
floor batching adds. Delivery uses binary `EventBatch` framing by default.

## Ordering

Within one stream (strictly: one shard of one stream), subscribers see
records in publish order. Across streams there is no ordering relationship at
all — two publishes to different streams may be observed in either order.
On a multi-shard stream, ordering is per routing key; see
[Benchmarks](/felix/features/benchmarks/) and the wire protocol page for how
keys map to shards.

## Isolation and backpressure

Each subscription gets its own bounded queue in the broker and its own QUIC
stream to the client, with its own flow-control window. Backpressure applies
at each level:

- **QUIC flow control** (per connection and per stream) bounds bytes in
  flight; a full window pauses that stream only.
- **The publish queue** (`pub_queue_depth`) bounds admitted-but-uncommitted
  publishes; when full, new publishes wait up to
  `publish_queue_wait_timeout_ms`, then fail. That failure means the broker
  is overloaded, and it is deliberately visible.
- **The subscriber queue** (`subscriber_queue_capacity`) bounds what one
  subscription can have pending. What happens when it fills is the overflow
  policy, and it is the crux:

![One slow subscriber and two fast ones, under each overflow policy. Under DropNew, the default, the slow subscriber's bounded queue fills and further records are dropped for that subscriber alone while the publisher and the fast subscribers run at full rate. Under Block nothing is dropped, and the publisher and both fast subscribers are pulled down to the slow subscriber's speed.](/felix/diagrams/slow-consumer.svg)

This is the trade the whole design turns on. Under the default a publisher never
waits on a subscriber, which is exactly why one stalled consumer cannot degrade
the rest — and exactly why a subscriber can silently miss records.

The overflow policy covers live records only. A subscription resumed from an
earlier offset reads history the broker pages off disk for it alone, with no
publisher to protect, so history below the subscription's `live_offset` is
never dropped: the client waits for room in its queue, and a slow reader slows
the replay instead of losing part of it.

`DropOld` is accepted in configuration and counted separately, but it currently
behaves as `DropNew`: the arriving record is the one discarded. The metric
`felix_sub_queue_drop_old_emulated_total` is what tells you that happened.

:::caution[At-Most-Once Semantics]
A dropped event is not redelivered. A subscriber that falls behind its queue
misses messages — but on a **durable** stream the loss is detectable and
recoverable: delivered events carry log offsets, so a gap in offsets is exactly
a drop, and the subscriber can resume from the offset it last saw. On an
ephemeral stream there is nothing to resume from.

If you need redelivery rather than detection, use a **consumer group**: it
acknowledges each record and hands back anything unanswered once the visibility
timeout lapses. See [Projections](/felix/architecture/projections/).
:::

## Delivery semantics

### At-most-once, per subscriber

This is what a plain subscription gives: no subscriber acknowledgements, no
redelivery, the lowest latency. The right fit for signals whose old values
are worthless — dashboards, telemetry, presence.

Ways a subscriber misses records: it fell behind its bounded queue, the
network partitioned, or the broker restarted while the stream was
**ephemeral**. A durable stream keeps its records across a restart, and a
subscriber resumes from the offset it last saw.

### At-least-once, via a consumer group

A different shape from `subscribe`: records are **pulled**, because only the
consumer knows when it has capacity for more work.

- Each record is claimed by one consumer and not handed to another while the
  claim holds
- An acknowledgement finishes a record; the group's cursor advances over a
  contiguous run, so acknowledging out of order cannot skip a gap
- Anything unanswered is redelivered once the visibility timeout lapses
- Redelivery is bounded: past `max_attempts` the record is dead-lettered
- Requires durable storage, and costs a round trip per settle

```rust
// Waits up to 5s for work rather than spinning on empty polls.
let records = client
    .group_poll_wait("tenant", "ns", "orders", shard, "fulfilment", 32, Duration::from_secs(5))
    .await?;

for record in records {
    match process_order(&record.payload) {
        Ok(()) => client.group_ack("tenant", "ns", "orders", shard, "fulfilment", record.offset).await?,
        // Hand it back for immediate redelivery instead of waiting out the timeout.
        Err(_) => client.group_nack("tenant", "ns", "orders", shard, "fulfilment", record.offset).await?,
    }
}
```

`record.attempts` carries how many times this record has been delivered, so a
consumer can treat a retry differently from a first attempt.

See [Queues](/felix/features/queues/) for dead letters, redrive, and the
ordering rules that make the cursor safe.

### Exactly-once is not planned

At-most-once and at-least-once are the two guarantees Felix intends to offer.
Deduplicating on receive has to happen in the application in any case — it is
the only layer that knows what makes two records the same — so deduplicate
there, keyed on something the record carries.

## Tuning

Start with the defaults and change things only off a measurement — the
defaults are what [Benchmarks](/felix/features/benchmarks/) measures. The
knobs pull in two directions:

**Toward latency** — smaller batches, shorter delays, shallower queues:

```yaml
event_batch_max_events: 8
event_batch_max_delay_us: 100
fanout_batch_size: 8
pub_queue_depth: 16
subscriber_queue_capacity: 64
subscriber_writer_lanes: 2
```

**Toward throughput** — bigger batches, deeper queues, more connections:

```yaml
event_batch_max_events: 256
event_batch_max_delay_us: 2000
fanout_batch_size: 256
pub_queue_depth: 512
subscriber_queue_capacity: 4096
subscriber_writer_lanes: 8
```

```rust
let quinn = quinn::ClientConfig::with_platform_verifier();
let config = ClientConfig {
    event_conn_pool: 16,
    publish_conn_pool: 8,
    publish_streams_per_conn: 4,
    event_router_max_pending: 4096,
    ..ClientConfig::optimized_defaults(quinn)
};
```

In a throughput-shaped configuration, per-message latency is dominated by
batch fill and queueing — the latency percentiles of a batched run measure
the queue, not the request.

## How this compares

Roughly: Kafka is durable-first and batch-oriented, with a far bigger
ecosystem and higher per-message latency; Redis pub/sub and NATS (core) are
fast fire-and-forget with no per-subscriber isolation or replay. Felix sits
between: at-most-once fanout with real isolation, plus durable streams and
consumer groups on the same log when you need replay or redelivery. If your
workload is heavy stream *processing* — joins, windows, transformations —
that layer does not exist here; use a processing framework on top, or a
system that ships one.
