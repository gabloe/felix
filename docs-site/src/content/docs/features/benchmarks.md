title: "Benchmarks"
---

Felix ships a reproducible benchmark harness (`latency-demo`) that measures
end-to-end pub/sub performance — client publish → broker fanout → client
delivery — over real QUIC connections with TLS 1.3. This page documents the
methodology, current results, the transport levers that matter, and how to
compare Felix against other pub/sub systems fairly.

## Running the benchmark

```bash
# Full matrix: latency-focused (batch=1) then throughput-focused (batch=64)
cargo run --release -p broker --bin latency-demo --all-features

# Single case
cargo run --release -p broker --bin latency-demo --all-features -- \
  --warmup 500 --total 20000 --payload 1024 --fanout 10 --batch 64
```

## Methodology

Numbers are only useful if they are honest. The harness enforces:

- **Truthful delivery windows.** Delivered throughput is computed from publish
  start to the instant the *last event actually arrived* — not to when drain
  tasks are joined. Trailing bookkeeping never inflates the denominator.
- **Lossless backpressure in both profiles.** The throughput profile
  (batch > 1) runs with blocking queues end-to-end and bounded ingress waits
  (`pub_ingress_wait`), so the publisher is paced to the pipeline's sustainable
  rate. The latency profile (batch = 1) blocks the broker's core
  per-subscriber queue and the client's own subscriber channel, not just the
  writer-lane queue below them — both defaulted to `DropNew` and could drop
  warmup/measurement messages under load before that was tightened. In both
  profiles **every message is delivered** (`unaccounted 0`). A subscriber that
  times out now fails the run rather than abandoning its remaining events, so a
  shortfall cannot be quietly reported as shedding. A number measured while
  shedding is not a throughput or latency number.
- **Latency mode measures per-message RTT.** The latency profile (batch = 1)
  publishes with per-message acks, measuring full round-trip behavior rather
  than fire-and-forget enqueue rates.
- **Warmup excluded.** Handshake, stream setup, path-MTU discovery, and
  congestion ramp are absorbed by warmup messages before measurement starts.
- **Fanout counted honestly.** `delivered throughput` counts every
  subscriber delivery; `per-sub throughput` divides by fanout.

### A run must exceed the send window

The single easiest way to publish a wrong throughput number: any batched run
whose total volume fits inside the 64 MiB QUIC connection send window is
absorbed by buffers before backpressure appears, so the harness reports
buffer-fill rate rather than sustained throughput. A 1 KiB run once appeared to
do 358 MB/s and actually sustained 74.9 MB/s.

Two guards now exist. `latency-demo` prints a warning when a `batch > 1` run's
volume is within ~2× the send window, and the matrix runner scales message
count per payload so every throughput cell clears it. Rule of thumb when
running by hand: **`payload × total` should comfortably exceed 128 MiB.**

### One session at a time

`data/raw/latency_demo_runs.jsonl` is append-only, so it accumulates every run
ever performed on the machine — across commits, branches, and code states.
Each matrix invocation therefore stamps a `session_id`, and
`normalize_and_aggregate.py` derives from the **latest session only** by
default. Pass `--session all` to include history, or `--session <id-prefix>`
to pick one. Without this the derived CSVs and every chart built from them mix
unrelated code states, which previously produced charts holding a single bar
with every other payload marked "no data".

## Results

Measured on an Apple M4 Max (macOS, APFS, loopback), release build, TLS 1.3
enabled — QUIC always encrypts, so per-packet crypto is inside every number
here. All runs are sized past the 64 MiB QUIC send window, so these are
sustained rates rather than buffer-fill (see
[methodology](#a-run-must-exceed-the-send-window)).

### Latency profile (batch = 1, per-message ack)

Table: medians of 5–10 trials per cell from the full matrix. Charts: refreshed
from the post-fix `task perf:fast` session (3 trials per cell); the two agree
within noise.

| Payload | Fanout 1 (p50 / p99 / p999) | Fanout 10 (p50 / p99 / p999) |
|---|---|---|
| 0 B | 127 / 165 / 214 µs | 184 / 278 / 340 µs |
| 256 B | 128 / 166 / 204 µs | 237 / 327 / 369 µs |
| 1 KiB | 131 / 176 / 251 µs | 247 / 351 / 417 µs |
| 4 KiB | 136 / 176 / 216 µs | 269 / 399 / 483 µs |

![Latency profile p50 by payload and publisher preset, fanout 1](/felix/charts/latency_demo/balanced/f1_b1_json_a8b3321b_p50.svg)

![Latency profile p99 by payload and publisher preset, fanout 10](/felix/charts/latency_demo/balanced/f10_b1_json_a8b3321b_p99.svg)

Fanout-10 tails improved sharply with the transport scheduling work: p99 went
from ~1.05–1.13 ms to 278–399 µs, and p999 from 1.32–2.09 ms to 340–483 µs —
roughly **3–4× better tail latency** at fanout 10, with fanout 1 also improving
(p99 199–212 µs → 165–176 µs). This profile is stable: 85% of cells hold a
p90/p10 trial spread under 1.5×.

### Throughput profile (batch = 64, binary, lossless, zero drops)

Seven trials per payload at fanout 1, fresh process per trial, idle machine,
default publisher pool (4 connections × 2 streams).

| Payload | Median | Payload rate | Slowest trial | Spread |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 256 B | 1,400,008 msg/s | **358 MB/s** | 1,361,493 | 1.05× |
| 1 KiB | 450,455 msg/s | **461 MB/s** | 425,703 | 1.12× |
| 4 KiB | 124,004 msg/s | **508 MB/s** | 121,968 | 1.03× |
| 16 KiB | 30,707 msg/s | **503 MB/s** | 30,120 | 1.04× |

Against the pre-fix ceiling of ~73 MB/s — which was flat across every payload
size — that is roughly a **7× improvement**, and the byte rate now rises with
payload size instead of pinning to a constant.

These are macOS figures. The transport work behind them is platform-neutral
and enabled everywhere, but Linux has not been re-measured on the fixed
pipeline, so no Linux numbers are published here yet.

:::note[Why the spread column is tight]
Trial-to-trial spread this narrow is itself a result of the path-MTU fix in
the [case study](/felix/features/performance-case-study/). Before it, a
congestive loss burst during ramp-up could trip QUIC's MTU black-hole
detector and pin a connection at a 1200-byte MTU for the rest of the run — a
~13× datagram (and syscall) multiplier that made roughly one run in three
land 5–6× low. Removing it also roughly doubled the 256 B row, by taking the
MTU discovery ramp out of short runs.

Medians of several trials remain the standard for anything published here —
that policy is what exposed the defect rather than averaging it away.

![Delivered payload MB/s by payload and publisher preset, fanout 1](/felix/charts/latency_demo/balanced/f1_b64_binary_a8b3321b_delivered_mb_per_s.svg)

![Delivered payload MB/s by payload and publisher preset, fanout 10](/felix/charts/latency_demo/balanced/f10_b64_binary_a8b3321b_delivered_mb_per_s.svg)

The charts come from the same post-fix matrix session as the latency charts
above (3 trials per cell, fresh session, run-size floor past the QUIC send
window). Publisher presets are within a few percent of each other at every
payload — connection count is not a throughput lever, as the
[QUIC transport page](/felix/features/quic-transport/) explains.

### Historical cross-platform comparison

:::note[These predate the transport fix and are kept for context only]
The tables below were measured before the scheduling work and on a mix of
macOS and a Linux devcontainer. Several macOS throughput rows are also
**buffer-absorption artifacts** — runs whose total volume fit inside the
64 MiB send window, so they report buffer-fill rate rather than sustained
throughput. Do not compare them against the numbers above; the Linux figures
in particular have not been re-measured on the fixed pipeline.
:::

| Payload | Fanout | macOS p50 / p99 / p999 | Linux p50 / p99 / p999 |
|---|---:|---|---|
| 0 B | 1 | 121 / 199 / 311 µs | 82 / 116 / 175 µs |
| 256 B | 1 | 128 / 208 / 263 µs | 91 / 172 / 241 µs |
| 1 KiB | 1 | 124 / 212 / 329 µs | 96 / 161 / 223 µs |
| 0 B | 10 | 460 µs / 1.09 / 1.49 ms | 98 / 147 / 193 µs |
| 256 B | 10 | 447 µs / 1.13 / 2.09 ms | 99 / 148 / 181 µs |
| 1 KiB | 10 | 444 µs / 1.05 / 1.32 ms | 142 / 720 µs / 4.96 ms |

#### Historical throughput (pre-fix, mixed platforms)

| Payload | Fanout | macOS JSON | Linux JSON | Linux binary |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 0 B | 1 | 650 K | 1.29 M | 1.23 M |
| 0 B | 10 | 2.46–2.58 M | 1.19 M | 2.92 M |
| 1 KiB | 1 | 244–263 K | 178 K | 442 K |
| 1 KiB | 10 | 410–460 K | 1.54 M | 1.57 M |
| 4 KiB | 1 | 62–87 K | 97 K | 120 K |
| 4 KiB | 10 | ~107 K | 499–561 K | 566–590 K |

Every row completes with `delivery drops 0`: these are sustainable rates under
end-to-end backpressure, not burst rates measured while shedding load. Rates
count subscriber deliveries. The Linux 4 KiB × fanout 10 binary result delivers
about **2.3 GB/s** of payload.

The 1 KiB × fanout 10 Linux figures are averages of five interleaved runs:
JSON averaged 1.541 M msg/s and binary averaged 1.569 M msg/s. Binary won three
of five runs, but the averages are within 2%, confirming that the earlier
single-run JSON lead was variance rather than an encoding-path reversal.

### Encode-once fanout CPU efficiency

An A/B run of 200 K deliveries at 1 KiB × fanout 10 showed broker/client
user-space CPU falling from 1.43–1.61 s to 0.58–0.67 s after shared event-frame
fanout: roughly **60% less user CPU per delivered message**. Delivered
throughput remained within variance at 410–431 K msg/s because macOS loopback
was dominated by UDP kernel time; the same change improved 4 KiB × fanout 10
p99 latency from 365 ms to 221 ms.

Linux GSO closes that kernel-bound gap decisively: 4 KiB × fanout 10 reaches
499–561 K JSON and 566–590 K binary delivered msg/s, up to roughly 5x the
macOS JSON rate. For the representative 1 KiB × fanout 10 binary workload,
`/usr/bin/time -v` reported 1.23 s user time and 0.33 s system time over
0.59 s wall time. The equivalent macOS run used about 0.6 s user and 3.3 s
system time. System time therefore fell by about 90%, flipping the workload
from roughly 5.5:1 system-dominated to 3.7:1 user-dominated.

This Linux workload is no longer syscall-bound. The "user-space scheduling and
synchronization" target this paragraph used to predict has since been
confirmed and fixed: throughput was clocked by scheduler wakeup latency on the
QUIC driver tasks — roughly one cross-thread wakeup chain per datagram — and
isolating those drivers onto dedicated single-threaded runtimes (plus pump
colocation and ACK-frequency tuning) raised sustained macOS loopback
throughput ~7.5×. See
[Concurrency internals](/felix/development/internals-concurrency/#the-quic-io-runtime)
for how that placement works.

## The transport levers that matter

These findings came out of profiling the QUIC path and are wired into
`felix-transport` defaults; each has an environment override:

| Lever | Default | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| `FELIX_MTU_UPPER_BOUND` | 16384 | Path-MTU discovery bound. quinn's stock 1452 caps loopback/jumbo paths at Ethernet size; bounding at the real path MTU (loopback lo0 = 16384) cut per-byte syscall and crypto costs ~7x for byte-heavy workloads. Small-message workloads can prefer ~4096 (finer ACK clocking, measured ~1.5x for 0-byte messages). |
| `FELIX_INITIAL_MTU` | 1200 | RFC-safe starting datagram size. Raise on known-good paths to skip discovery entirely. |
| `FELIX_INITIAL_CWND` | Quinn RFC default | Optional initial congestion-window override for trusted low-loss paths. Quinn raises its minimum window to two datagrams when path-MTU discovery finds a larger MTU; the measured default workloads did not benefit from a larger initial burst. |
| `FELIX_UDP_SEND_BUFFER` / `FELIX_UDP_RECV_BUFFER` | 8 MiB | Socket buffers absorb bursts; kernel-level drops surface as QUIC retransmits and tail-latency spikes. Applied best-effort (halved until the OS accepts). |
| `FELIX_MAX_UDP_PAYLOAD` | 65527 | Receive-side datagram cap. Must exceed the peer's discovered MTU or large datagrams are silently rejected. |
| `FELIX_IO_RUNTIME_THREADS` | CPU parallelism | Quinn's driver tasks run on a pool of dedicated single-threaded runtimes (one endpoint per runtime), isolated from application tasks. Driver re-poll latency is the transport's throughput ceiling, and this isolation is the single largest lever found (~7.5× sustained on macOS loopback). `0` restores the old shared-runtime behavior. In-process multi-endpoint setups prefer a small pool; `latency-demo` pins `2`. |
| `FELIX_ACK_ELICITING_THRESHOLD` | 20 | ACK-frequency extension (quinn peers): ACK at most every N ack-eliciting packets instead of every other, with a 2 ms max ACK delay. Each reverse-path ACK costs a datagram plus its wakeup chain; ~+15% throughput measured. `FELIX_ACK_FREQ_DISABLE=1` restores stock quinn ACK behavior. |

Broker-side levers (see [Configuration](/felix/reference/configuration/)):
`pub_inflight_bytes` (ingress byte budget), `pub_ingress_wait` (lossless
backpressure vs. shed-on-overload), subscriber queue policies
(`block` / `drop_new` / `drop_old`) and depths, and `core_shards`
(`FELIX_CORE_SHARDS`) — thread-per-core stream ownership: each stream's
publish worker and lane feeders run on a dedicated core-pinned runtime
(Linux pinning; dedicated threads elsewhere). Measured lossless (zero drops):
+27% on a 4-stream × fanout-4 workload (1.24M → 1.59M msg/s, unpinned macOS);
on Linux (devcontainer), +25% single-stream (1 KiB × fanout 10: 1.63M → 2.04M
msg/s) and parity-to-2.5× multi-stream with high environment variance — never
below baseline in any run. **Caveat:** the 2026-08 investigation found these
`core_shards` gains were likely measured under the buffer-absorption artifact
(run volumes inside the send window). Re-measured on the fixed pipeline in
the workload the feature targets (4 streams × fanout 4 × 1 KiB × batch 64,
five fresh runs per arm, macOS): shards 0 median 661 K msg/s delivered,
shards 4 median 668 K — **+1%, within run-to-run variance**. The off-by-default
setting stands; treat `core_shards` as a placement experiment to validate on
your own hardware, not a general throughput lever.

## Saturation behavior

Felix's production defaults favor **bounded latency with visible overload**:
subscriber queues default to `drop_new`, so an overloaded subscriber sheds
(counted in `felix_subscribe_dropped_total`) instead of growing unbounded
backlog. Flip to lossless pacing per deployment with
`FELIX_SUB_QUEUE_POLICY=block` + `FELIX_PUB_INGRESS_WAIT=1` when producers
should slow down rather than lose events.

## Comparing against other pub/sub systems

Cross-system numbers are only meaningful when measured side-by-side on the
same hardware, same payload sizes, same fanout, and same delivery guarantees.
Published figures for other brokers vary by an order of magnitude across
hardware and configurations, so treat any single citation with suspicion —
including ours. Structural differences to keep in mind:

- **Transport & encryption.** Felix runs QUIC with mandatory TLS 1.3 —
  per-packet crypto is included in every number above. NATS/Redis/Kafka
  benchmarks are typically plaintext TCP; enabling TLS on those systems
  materially changes their numbers.
- **Delivery model.** The Felix numbers above are *lossless, backpressured,
  fanout-counted* rates. Many published pub/sub benchmarks report publisher
  enqueue rates or allow silent slow-consumer drops (e.g. Redis client output
  buffer limits, NATS slow-consumer disconnects).
- **Batching.** Kafka-class systems trade latency for batch throughput;
  compare them against Felix's batch=64 profile, not the latency profile.

For a like-for-like harness against NATS on the same machine:

```bash
# NATS side (requires nats-server + nats CLI)
nats-server &
nats bench benchsubject --pub 1 --sub 10 --size 1024 --msgs 100000

# Felix side, matching shape
cargo run --release -p broker --bin latency-demo --all-features -- \
  --warmup 500 --total 100000 --payload 1024 --fanout 10 --batch 64
```

Compare *delivered* (per-subscriber × fanout) rates and tail latencies, and
match TLS configuration on both sides before drawing conclusions.

## Continuous benchmarking

Three CI workflows keep this data honest and current, rather than relying on
someone remembering to re-run the harness by hand:

- **`.github/workflows/perf-pr.yml`** — on every PR, builds and benchmarks
  both the PR's merge-base and the PR head back-to-back on the same runner
  instance (a small fast subset, not the full matrix below), then posts a
  PR comment comparing them via a Welch's t-test
  (`scripts/perf/compare_benchmarks.py`). Running both sides on the same
  runner controls for GitHub Actions' shared/virtualized runner noise far
  better than comparing against a historical stored value. Advisory only —
  it does not block merging.
- **`.github/workflows/perf-publish.yml`** — on every merge to `main`, runs
  the same fast subset once and publishes it as a historical time series
  (via `benchmark-action/github-action-benchmark`, stored on the
  `benchmark-data` branch) so trends over time are browsable.
- **`.github/workflows/perf-comprehensive.yml`** — the full matrix below,
  on a weekly schedule or manual dispatch (too slow — roughly 1,000
  individual runs — for every PR or every merge). Produces the artifacts
  used to regenerate this page; see below.

### Historical dashboards

Every successful performance publish updates the live dashboards on GitHub
Pages:

- [Latency history](../../benchmarks/latency/)
- [Throughput history](../../benchmarks/throughput/)

The dashboards are generated by `github-action-benchmark`, stored on the
`benchmark-data` branch, and copied into the documentation artifact whenever
the Pages workflow runs. Each chart includes:

- the latest result and its percentage change from the prior rolling median;
- all-history and configurable prior-commit median reference lines;
- a one-standard-deviation noise band from the five trials;
- the existing regression-alert threshold relative to the previous commit;
- best, worst, and latest coefficient-of-variation summaries;
- markers when the benchmark configuration fingerprint changes; and
- zero-based/trend-focused axis and annotation controls.

The alert line is a regression threshold, not a production SLO. Hover a point
for trial count, mean, standard deviation, runner details, Rust version,
measurement semantics, and configuration fingerprint.

:::caution[Dashboard numbers are not comparable to the results above]
The dashboards run on **shared, virtualized GitHub-hosted runners**; the
[Results](#results) table above was measured on a dedicated Apple Silicon
host. Expect the dashboard figures to land roughly **1.4–3× below** the
documented Linux numbers — for example ~166 K msg/s for 1 KiB × fanout 1
batch-64 on CI versus 442 K on the dev host. That gap is hardware, not a
regression.

Read the dashboards for **trend over time and PR-vs-baseline deltas**, and
this page for **absolute capability on real hardware**. The per-PR check
(`perf-pr.yml`) is meaningful precisely because it benchmarks both sides
back-to-back on the *same* runner instance, so the hardware term cancels;
a single dashboard datapoint in isolation carries much less signal.

The two dashboards are also deliberately split by profile and are not
interchangeable. The batch-64 throughput profile paces the publisher with
lossless end-to-end backpressure, so its latency percentiles are dominated
by intentional queueing (tens of milliseconds) and say nothing about
per-message latency. Batch-1 latency and batch-64 throughput are the
meaningful readings from each.
