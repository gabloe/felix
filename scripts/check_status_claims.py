"""Find claims about what Felix has *not* built, so they can be re-read when it is.

`check_doc_evidence.py` proves a cited test exists. It cannot prove the prose
still matches, and the claims that rot worst are not the ones citing tests —
they are the ones saying a thing does not exist yet. Those are written once and
then outlive the feature shipping, because nothing about shipping a feature
makes anyone grep the docs for sentences that said it was missing.

That is a real failure, not a hypothetical: metadata Raft shipped across
#345-#354 and five pages went on saying it "is not started", including an SVG's
alt text reused on three of them.

Normative-language checkers do not find these. A sweep for "always / never /
guarantees / cannot / must" across the docs site returns ~321 sentences and
would have caught none of the Raft drift; widening it to "is" returns ~1709,
which is a report nobody reads. The phrases below return far fewer, and they
are the ones that go stale on a milestone close.

Two modes:

  --report        list every such claim, grouped by file. The point is to make
                  the uncovered surface visible; it exits 0.
  --check-issues  for claims that cite an issue, ask GitHub whether that issue
                  is closed. A closed issue under a "not built" sentence is
                  drift, and this is the only fully automatic signal for it.
                  Skipped without `gh`, so CI and offline both work.

Run `--report` when closing a milestone; that is the moment these go wrong.
