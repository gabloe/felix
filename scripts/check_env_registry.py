"""Verify `felix_common::env_registry::KNOWN_VARS` lists every `FELIX_*` read.

The registry is what turns a mistyped variable into a warning naming the
setting that is quietly using its default. A variable added to the code and not
to the list inverts that: the real name gets reported as unknown, which trains
an operator to ignore the warning entirely.

Sibling to `check_env_reference.py`, which checks the *documentation* covers
every variable. This checks the *runtime* does.
