# POSIX sh body, run ON the load generator under dash as root via run-command.
# seed.sh prepends a header assigning CP / BOOTSTRAP / BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN /
# IDP_TOKEN / IDP_JWKS_URL / IDP_AUDIENCE / TENANT / NAMESPACE /
# REPLICATION_FACTOR, then concatenates this file. Keep it dash-clean: no

# The flow is the deployment's own, not a harness shortcut:
#   1. bootstrap-initialize the tenant with the real IdP's issuer + JWKS
#   2. exchange the IdP token for the Felix operator token
#   3. create the namespace, streams, and cache scope the matrix uses
# The felix token is written to ~felix/felix-session/token for run.sh and
# framed on stdout so seed.sh can relay it to the brokers as their node token.
#
# Every step is idempotent (409 "already exists" is tolerated) so a re-run
# after a partial seed converges instead of wedging, and every non-2xx prints
# its status and body so a failure is legible in the run-command message rather
# than a bare stall.

# control plane can see at that instant -- and nothing ever moves a shard
# afterwards (#130). Create the streams while only the first broker has
# registered and it takes all of them; the rest of the cluster then sits idle
# for the whole session with no remedy short of deleting the streams, which
# destroys their data. A two-broker session measured exactly that: 49/0.
