# ceiling and read MB/s per vCPU (the number that survives a disk-bound
# comparison). Distributes the client token to the extra loadgens, runs the
# ingest scenario on all of them in parallel against the durable stream, samples
# every broker's CPU breakdown at the peak, and sums throughput. Captures full
# per-loadgen output so a failed loadgen is visible, not silently dropped.

# The previous version ran `top` mid-run through `az vm run-command`, which has
# seconds of dispatch latency -- often landing after a ~26s case had finished,
# and reporting an idle machine. It once recorded the *only* broker doing any
# writing (14.3M appends) as 100% idle, which is worse than no number at all.
#
# Instead: arm a sampler on every broker before the load starts, difference
# /proc/stat at 1 Hz, and afterwards average only the samples that were
# actually busy. That keeps the idle head and tail out of the mean, and it is
# the method that produced the clean 50-51% reading behind #535. `top` also
# cannot be trusted for softirq, which is ~10% of a loaded broker (QUIC/UDP and
# AEAD) and the difference between "CPU bound" and "waiting".
