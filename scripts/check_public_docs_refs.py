"""Keep internal project tracking out of the published documentation.

The docs site is read by people deploying Felix. Milestone labels — "M13
complete", "Replication is M5", "Packaged charts are M9's job" — mean nothing
to them: they name rows on a project board this reader has never seen, and
they date the page the moment the milestone closes. A capability statement
("this is available, here is what it survives") says the same thing to the
reader who matters and does not go stale on a board update.

Unlike the status claims in `check_status_claims.py`, this one can be a hard
gate: a milestone label in a published page is wrong on the day it is written,
so there is nothing to weigh.

Issue links are deliberately allowed. A public issue URL is a reasonable
citation for "the tracking discussion lives here" and stays meaningful to an
outside reader; a milestone number does not.
