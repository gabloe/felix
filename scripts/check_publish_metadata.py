"""Enforce the licence split and crates.io publish-readiness across the workspace.

Run via `task publish:check`.

# Why this exists
The licence split in LICENSING.md is a legal boundary that lives in fifteen
separate manifests. Nothing structural stops a new crate from silently landing on
the wrong side of it, and the failure is invisible until someone reads the
manifest. This turns the LICENSING.md table into an assertion.

# Why it shells out to `cargo metadata`
Manifests use workspace inheritance (`license.workspace = true`), so parsing the
raw TOML sees the string "workspace" rather than the resolved licence and would
validate nothing while appearing to pass. `cargo metadata` reports resolved
values, which is the only trustworthy source.
