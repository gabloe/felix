"""Verify that every environment variable the code reads is documented.

`docs-site/.../reference/environment-variables.md` calls itself a reference, and
a reference that silently omits a knob is worse than one that says it is partial
-- an operator concludes the setting does not exist. The page had drifted to
missing 59 of them before this check existed.

Variables used only by benchmarks, demos and the test harness are excluded by
name below rather than documented: they are not operational surface, and listing
them would bury the ones that are.
