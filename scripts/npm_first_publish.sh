# Claim the npm package names for a release, by hand, from a maintainer's own
# machine.
#
# # Why this is not the release workflow's job
# npm has no way for CI to create a package that does not exist yet. npm's docs
# require the package to exist before a trusted publisher can be configured
# (npm/cli#8544 tracks lifting that), and `npm stage publish` stages a new
# version of an existing package -- it answers 404 for a name it has never
# seen:
#
#   POST /-/stage/package/felix-client-darwin-arm64
#   404 Package "felix-client-darwin-arm64" not found
#
# What is left is a direct publish, which needs either a token that bypasses
# 2FA -- restricted, and losing the ability to publish around January 2027 --
# or a person who can answer the 2FA prompt.
#
# A person, then. Once per package name, ever: after this, the packages exist,
# trusted publishers can be configured on them, and CI publishes every later
# version with no credential at all.
#
# The binaries come from the GitHub release rather than a local build, so what
# is published is what CI built and what the conformance suite ran against.

All six are on npm. Two things to do now, once:

  1. Configure a trusted publisher on each package -- repository gabloe/felix,
     workflow release.yml, environment npm.
  2. Delete the NPM_TOKEN secret. Nothing reads it once npm_stage is off.

Every later release then publishes from CI with no credential at all.
DONE
