"""Fail a change to the code the TLA+ model describes that leaves the model alone.

`check_spec_evidence.py` catches a spec citing a test that no longer exists. It
cannot catch the drift that actually happened: #268 changed the replication
protocol without touching a test the spec cited, and without touching the spec,
and the model went on describing the old design for three weeks (#598).

So this forces the confrontation. A change touching the modelled paths below
must also touch `docs/formal/`, or say why it does not with a line

    Spec-Unaffected: <reason>

in a commit message or the pull request description. It is deliberately blunt:
most edits to these files are not protocol changes, and the marker is how you
say so. What it buys is that nobody changes the protocol without being asked
whether the model still describes it. It says nothing about whether a spec
change is *right*.

Usage:

    check_spec_pairing.py --base <rev>     # diff <rev>...HEAD

`PR_BODY`, if set, is searched for the marker along with the commit messages.
