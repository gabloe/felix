# Contributing to Felix

Thanks for your interest in contributing. Before your first pull request is
merged, please read this — it's short.

## License Split

Felix uses a split license: the wire protocol, client SDK, transport layer,
shared types, and conformance suite are Apache-2.0; the broker and
control-plane server components are the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0. See
[LICENSING.md](LICENSING.md) for the full breakdown of which path is under
which license. Know which part of the tree your PR touches before you start.

## Contributor License Agreement

Every contribution needs two things, regardless of which license path it
lands in — this keeps the project able to evolve its licensing over time
without ever needing to track down past contributors individually:

1. **DCO sign-off** — certify you wrote (or have the right to submit) the
   code, by adding `-s` to your commit:

   ```bash
   git commit -s -m "your message"
   ```

   This adds a `Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.com>` trailer. It's the
   same mechanism used by the Linux kernel and Docker.

2. **CLA grant** — on your first pull request, the CLA Assistant bot will
   comment asking you to reply with a fixed phrase to sign. The full text is
   in [CLA.md](CLA.md); in short, you confirm the contribution is your
   original work (or you have the right to submit it) and grant the project
   a broad, non-exclusive license to use and relicense it — **without**
   transferring your copyright. You only sign once, not per-PR.

## AI-Assisted Contributions

AI tools (Claude, Copilot, etc.) are fine to use — this project does. Two
things to keep in mind:

- **You're responsible for what you submit.** Review AI-generated or
  AI-assisted code as if you wrote it yourself; the CLA/DCO sign-off is
  still your assertion that you have the right to submit it.
- **Disclose substantial AI assistance** in the PR description (tool used,
  roughly how much of the change). This is about transparency for
  reviewers, not a restriction — a one-line note like "drafted with Claude
  Code, reviewed and tested by me" is enough.

## Getting Started

- `cargo build --workspace` builds everything.
- `task test` runs the full test suite (spins up Postgres locally if Docker
  is available).
- `task lint` runs `cargo fmt --check` and `cargo clippy -D warnings` — both
  must pass in CI.
- See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for how the pieces fit together
  and [docs/](docs/) for design docs.

## How the code is organized

These rules are what reviewers will hold a change to. Most of them exist so
that someone new can find their way from the directory tree alone.

### Crates

- Crates are grouped by role under `crates/` (`protocol`, `server`, `sdk`,
  `testing`), and the deployables live in `services/`. The directory is always
  named after the package. [crates/README.md](crates/README.md) says what each
  group is for.
- Put a new crate in the group whose users it shares. Crate names start with
  `felix-`; published names are permanent, so choose carefully.
- Shared dependency versions go in `[workspace.dependencies]`. Members add
  features, they don't re-pin versions.

### Modules

- One module style: `foo.rs` with its children in `foo/`. No `mod.rs`
  (clippy enforces this), no `#[path]`, no `include!` of Rust source.
- `lib.rs` is a table of contents: the crate docs, the module declarations
  and the re-exports. Types and functions live in modules.
- Group modules by what they are about (`stream/`, `queue/`, `publish/`),
  not by kind of code. Avoid grab-bag names like `utils`, `helpers`,
  `common`, `misc` or `types`. A module named after its parent
  (`client/client.rs`) is a sign the parent is the wrong shape.
- Default to `pub(crate)`. Use `pub` only for what another crate uses;
  `unreachable_pub` enforces this.
- Split a file when it holds two ideas with separate invariants, not because
  of its length. That said, a file past about 800 lines of non-test code
  usually holds more than one idea.

### Inside a file

Write a file so it reads top-down: the thing a reader came for first, the
details below it.

1. The `//!` module doc: what this module is for, and anything a reader must
   know before changing it.
2. `mod` declarations, then `pub use` re-exports.
3. `use` imports in three blocks separated by a blank line: `std`, external
   crates, then `crate::`/`super::`.
4. Constants.
5. The main type of the module, then its inherent `impl`, then its trait
   impls. Keep every impl for a type next to the type.
6. Supporting types, in the order they are first used.
7. Free functions, public before private.
8. `#[cfg(test)] mod tests;` last.

Inside an `impl`: constructors, then accessors, then operations in the order
a caller uses them, then private helpers.

### Tests

- Unit tests go in `<module>/tests.rs`, declared as `#[cfg(test)] mod tests;`
  at the bottom of the module. When that file grows past several hundred
  lines, make it a hub for shared helpers with themed files under
  `<module>/tests/`.
- Integration tests go in the crate's `tests/`. Related files that share
  setup can be one binary: `tests/<area>/main.rs` with a module per file.
  Keep a test in a binary of its own when it changes process-wide state such
  as environment variables.

## Pull Requests

- Keep PRs focused; a bug fix doesn't need an unrelated refactor along for
  the ride.
- Add tests for new behavior.
- `task lint` and `task test` should pass locally before you open a PR — CI
  runs both plus `cargo-deny`.
