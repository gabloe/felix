//! # Felix demo: slow-consumer isolation
//!
//! ## What this shows
//! One telemetry stream, three dashboard consumers. Partway through, one consumer
//! stops draining — a blocked render loop, a degraded link, a paused container. The
//! demo runs that identical scenario twice, under the two subscriber-queue policies,
//! and puts the results side by side.
//!
//! Under `drop_new` (the production default) the fault stays local: the healthy
//! consumers keep their rate and their tail latency, the publisher is never
//! throttled, and the stalled consumer sheds events that are counted and gone.
//!
//! Under `block` nothing is lost, and the cost lands everywhere: the stalled
//! consumer backpressures the publisher, which slows delivery to the healthy
//! consumers too.
//!
//! ## Why this demo exists
//! `docs-site/docs/getting-started/what-felix-is-for.md` describes Felix today as
//! "optimized for high-fanout delivery with predictable tail latency and strict
//! slow-consumer isolation". This is that claim, made runnable.
//!
//! Neither policy is the right answer. Quoting
//! `docs-site/docs/development/how-felix-works.md`: "dropping isolates healthy
//! publishers and subscribers from a slow consumer; blocking preserves delivery but
//! can let one slow subscriber throttle every producer of that stream." Which one you
//! want is a product decision. The demo exists to make the decision concrete.
//!
//! ## Honest limits
//! Single-node, loopback, fanout 3. These numbers say nothing about behaviour at
//! thousands of subscribers or across a real network. Dropped events are gone
//! permanently — Felix is at-most-once today, with no replay and no redelivery.
