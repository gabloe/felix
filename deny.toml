# TODO: These ignores are TEMPORARY and must be removed.
#
# RUSTSEC-2023-0071 (rsa / Marvin Attack):
# The RustCrypto `rsa` crate uses a non–constant-time implementation that can
# leak private key material via timing side channels. This is unacceptable for
# network-facing services (broker/controlplane) that sign or verify tokens.
# We must remove `rsa` entirely from production code paths (e.g. migrate Felix
# tokens to Ed25519 or a ring/aws-lc-backed implementation).
#
# RUSTSEC-2024-0370:
# This advisory indicates a known vulnerability with no currently enforced
# mitigation in our dependency graph. Ignoring it weakens our supply-chain
# security guarantees and risks shipping known-bad cryptographic behavior.
# We must either upgrade away from the affected crate or replace it.
