//! Broker membership API. A broker registers on boot and then reports health
//! on an interval; the control plane records the last report and a sweep marks
//! silent nodes down.
//!
//! A heartbeat records liveness only — it never revives a node the cluster
//! already marked down, and never resurrects a superseded incarnation. The
//! clock is always the control plane's, not the caller's, so a broker cannot
//! claim a future heartbeat and outlive its timeout.
//!
//! Every write requires `node.manage` over the node being changed. A broker's
//! credential is scoped to `node:{its own id}`, so it cannot register, drain,
//! deregister, patch, or report health for another broker; an operator holding
//! `cluster:*` can manage the whole fleet. Deleting a record takes `cluster:*`
//! outright. Reads require
//! `node.view:cluster:*`, since the listing exposes the cluster's network
//! layout.
