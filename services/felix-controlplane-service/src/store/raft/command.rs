//! The metadata command set: every mutation of the store, as data.
//!
//! One variant per mutating store-trait method, shaped like the API call
//! rather than the rows it touches — that is what makes multi-step
//! operations (a tenant bootstrap, a cascading delete) atomic under Raft for
//! free: the log totally orders whole operations, so there is no interleaved
//! half to protect against.
//!
//! Everything nondeterministic is **in** the command, decided before it is
//! proposed: heartbeat and expiry carry their timestamps, bootstrap carries
//! its candidate signing keys. Applying a command reads nothing but the
//! command and prior state, which is the property the determinism harness in
//! `state_machine/tests.rs` enforces.
//!
//! That leaves the question of *whose* clock a carried timestamp is. For the
//! ones that get compared against a reading taken elsewhere, the answer has
//! to be the leader's, and [`restamp`] is how it becomes so.
//!
//! The wire form is a versioned JSON envelope. A follower that does not
//! understand a command must fail loudly rather than misparse it: skipping a
//! committed command it cannot read would silently fork its state from the
//! leader's.
