//! The bounded change log behind every `*_changes` feed.

use crate::store::export::ExportedLog;

/// Bounded, in-memory append-only log of changes for a single entity type.
///
/// The log is keyed by a monotonically increasing `seq` that is assigned by this process.
/// - `record()` assigns the next sequence number, appends the change, and evicts older items when
///   the configured capacity is exceeded.
/// - Eviction means a consumer may miss changes if it polls too slowly; in that case it must
///   re-bootstrap by calling the corresponding `*_snapshot()` API.
///
/// This structure is intentionally simple. Unlike the Postgres backend:
/// - There is no transactional coupling between authoritative state and the change log.
/// - Atomicity is achieved by sequencing operations under locks.
