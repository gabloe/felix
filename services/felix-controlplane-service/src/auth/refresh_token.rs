//! Refresh tokens: what one is, and what the store must do with it.
//!
//! The access token stays short-lived because a leaked bearer token is only as
//! dangerous as the time it stays valid. That is the right trade for a caller
//! that can re-exchange freely, and the wrong one for anything long-running —
//! a broker holding a 900s node token falls out of the cluster in fifteen
//! minutes. A refresh token is how something stays authenticated without
//! either standing IdP credentials or a long-TTL bearer secret.
//!
//! Three properties make that safe, and all three live here rather than in the
//! endpoint, because a store that implements them differently is a store that
//! silently weakens them:
//!
//! - **The secret is never stored.** Only its hash, so a database read does not
//!   yield usable credentials.
//! - **Every refresh is single-use.** Using one mints its replacement and
//!   spends it, which bounds how long a stolen token is worth anything.
//! - **A replay revokes the family.** Single-use makes theft *detectable*:
//!   nobody legitimately presents a spent token, so seeing one means two
//!   parties hold the chain and neither should keep it.
