//! The metadata Raft core: group lifecycle, persistent log, and the seam.
//!
//! This module is the **entire** openraft surface of the control plane — no
//! openraft type escapes it. Everything outside talks to [`RaftHandle`] and
//! implements [`AppStateMachine`], which is what lets the consensus library
//! be upgraded (openraft is pre-1.0) or replaced without touching the store
//! traits or handlers. The design, including why openraft and why the log
//! lives outside `felix-storage`, is `docs/metadata-raft-design.md`.
//!
//! What lives where:
//! - `handle` — starting a member, forming and changing the group, stopping.
//! - `proposal` — committing a command from any member, forwarding to the
//!   leader when this one is not it.
//! - `health` — whether this member is fit to serve, and its gauges.
//! - `store` — the Raft log, vote, and current snapshot, in one crash-safe
//!   redb file per instance. Consensus state is the one thing here that must
//!   never lie about being on disk.
//! - `network` / `http` — Raft RPCs as JSON over HTTP between instances,
//!   riding the same listener the control plane already runs.
//! - `types` — the openraft type configuration. Commands and responses are
//!   opaque bytes at this layer; their meaning belongs to the application
//!   state machine (#338 gives them theirs).

/// The application half of the state machine seam.
///
/// The Raft core feeds every committed command to exactly one of these, in
/// log order, on every member. The contract that makes that meaningful:
///
/// - **`apply` must be deterministic.** Same command sequence, same state,
///   byte-identical `snapshot()` — on every instance, every time. No clocks,
///   no randomness, nothing read from outside the command and prior state.
///   Anything nondeterministic (timestamps, generated keys) is decided
///   *before* the command is proposed and carried inside it.
/// - The implementation owns its interior mutability; calls arrive
///   serialized from a single apply loop, but snapshot building may read
///   concurrently with nothing else, so a lock the implementation already
///   holds for serving reads is the right shape (the metadata store's
///   `RwLock`s, in #338).
/// - `restore` replaces the whole state with a previously produced snapshot.
///
/// Async because the metadata store's interior locks are async; the
/// determinism rule is about *what* apply computes, not how it schedules.
