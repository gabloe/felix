//! Deterministic shard placement.
//!
//! **Bounded-load rendezvous hashing.** Score every eligible node against the
//! shard and take the highest — but skip a node already carrying its balanced
//! share, so the shard spills to the next node under its share. Rendezvous is
//! chosen over a consistent-hash ring because it needs no ring state, no
//! virtual-node tuning, and removing a node only moves the shards that node
//! held; the load bound is added because plain highest-random-weight balances
//! only in the limit of many keys, and a cluster starts at a handful of shards
//! (24 over three brokers skewed 11/5/8) where the bound is the difference
//! between even use and single-node saturation. See `choose`.
//!
//! Everything here is a pure function of a metadata snapshot. That is what makes
//! "the same snapshot always yields the same placement" testable rather than
//! hoped for, and it keeps the algorithm out of the store.
//!
//! **Moves.** A shard whose leader is alive is moved, not reassigned: the
//! destination is staged as a replica, caught up, and made leader only after
//! the old leader has stopped and said so. Each step is an assignment write,
//! so any instance resumes a half-done move from the store. See `move_step`
//! and `docs/replication-design.md`. Two triggers: a draining node gives up
//! what it leads, and a node over its share gives shards to one under it,
//! bounded by `MovePolicy`.
//!
//! `NodeCapacity::weight` is ignored: weighted rendezvous needs a logarithm,
//! and floating point that must agree bit-for-bit across instances is a bad
//! foundation for a decision that has to be identical everywhere.
