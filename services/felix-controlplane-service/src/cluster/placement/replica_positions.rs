//! Which replicas hold a shard's log, as their leaders last reported.
//!
//! Promotion is gated on this. Without it a lost leader cannot be replaced at
//! all — see `docs/replication-design.md` — and with a *wrong* answer it can be
//! replaced by a broker holding less than it claims, which is worse.
//!
//! # Why the leader reports it
//!
//! The leader is the only party that knows both ends of the comparison: its own
//! tail, and how far each follower has acknowledged. A follower knows only where
//! it is, not whether that is caught up.
//!
//! # Why the reports live in the store
//!
//! The instance a report reaches and the instance that later promotes a
//! replica need not be the same process. Under Postgres every instance
//! serves, so a report held in one instance's memory was a position no other
//! promoter could use — an acknowledgement resting on it could not be made
//! good at failover. Reports go through [`ControlPlaneStore`] like every
//! other fact placement decides on, and this module is only the reading of
//! them: which replicas a plan may promote, as of one instant.
//!
//! # Why reports expire
//!
//! A report says a follower *was* caught up at the moment it was made. The
//! leader then keeps writing, and the follower may fall behind. Promoting on a
//! stale report is how a failover silently loses the records written after it.
//!
//! So a report is only believed for a bounded time — long enough to outlive the
//! window in which a leader's death is noticed, and no longer. The bound is
//! derived from the liveness settings rather than configured separately: those
//! already say how quickly a dead leader is detected, and a report has to
//! survive exactly that long to be usable.
//!

/// Believe a report for twice the expiry timeout plus one heartbeat.
///
/// It has to outlive the *detection* of a dead leader, and detection is
/// slower than it first looks. A leader is declared down an expiry timeout
/// after its last **heartbeat**, and its last **report** is older still —
/// by up to one reporting interval, which the control plane does not know
/// and cannot bound.
///
/// A window of `expiry + heartbeat` therefore closes at almost exactly the
/// moment the leader becomes eligible for replacement, and a report that
/// expires a moment too early makes the shard unpromotable *forever*:
/// nothing else will ever report on it, because the only broker that could
/// is the one that died. That failure is permanent, where believing a report
/// slightly too long costs at most the records written between the last
/// report and the death — which is the loss window `Leader` already
/// documents, and which `Quorum` bounds by requiring a majority anyway.
///
/// So the asymmetry decides it: too short is a shard that never comes back,
/// too long is a bounded and already-documented exposure.
