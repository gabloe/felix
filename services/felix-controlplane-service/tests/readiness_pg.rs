#![cfg(feature = "pg-tests")]
//! Readiness, against a database that can actually fail (#122).
//!
//! `src/api/readiness/tests.rs` proves the mechanism — the cache window, the
//! timeout, the draining short-circuit — against a fake probe that fails on
//! command. What it cannot prove is the part the acceptance criteria are
//! written about: that a *real* Postgres going away takes this instance out of
//! rotation, that it comes back on its own, and that neither event makes
//! liveness lie. A fake that returns `Err` is not evidence about a database.
//!
//! So these run the real router over a real `PostgresStore`, reached through a
//! proxy this test can cut and restore. Cutting the proxy is a genuine outage
//! from the pool's point of view: connections drop, new ones are refused, and
//! nothing in the process knows it was deliberate.
//!
//! Run with `cargo test -p felix-controlplane-service --features pg-tests readiness_pg`.
//! Skipped, not failed, when no database is reachable — same rule as the other
//! pg-tests, so a machine without docker still runs the rest of the suite.
//!
//! Every test here is `#[serial]`: they share one database, and the schema
//! test below removes the newest `_sqlx_migrations` row for a moment. A
//! concurrent `connect()` in that window re-runs the migration against a
//! schema that already has it and fails on its first non-idempotent statement.
