//! The broker's own credential, and keeping it current.
//!
//! A broker reads its node token once and then uses it for every control-plane
//! call it will ever make — heartbeat, node catalog, shard-assignment feed,
//! replication reports. When that token expires those calls start answering
//! `401` and the broker falls out of the cluster without anything having gone
//! wrong with the broker. The real-network suite watched exactly that: a 900s
//! token, and brokers deregistering fifteen minutes in.
//!
//! The answer is not a longer token — a long-lived bearer secret is what the
//! short default exists to avoid. It is refreshing before expiry, which means
//! the credential has to be a thing that can *change* while requests are using
//! it. Hence [`NodeCredential`]: one holder every caller reads through, swapped
//! atomically.
