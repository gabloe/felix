//! [`quic`] accepts connections, decodes frames and runs the per-message work.
//! [`auth`] checks the token on each action. `cache_routing` decides which
//! broker answers for a cache key, `group_ops` is the consumer-group work
//! behind the queue handlers, and [`core_shards`] pins stream work to cores.
//! [`kafka`] is the read-only Kafka listener around the `felix-kafka` crate.
//! [`forward`] sends a publish or cache operation to the broker that owns its
//! shard, and answers the ones other brokers send here.
