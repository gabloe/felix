//! Running a broker node: startup order, readiness gating and the shutdown drain.
//!
//! ## Process lifecycle
//! - The broker starts long-running background tasks (QUIC accept loop, metrics server,
//!   and optional control-plane sync).
//! - The process remains alive until the provided shutdown future completes. In
//!   production that is SIGTERM or SIGINT: SIGTERM is what Kubernetes, systemd, and
//!   `docker stop` send, so handling only SIGINT would abort in-flight work on every
//!   rolling update.
//! - Shutdown then runs a bounded drain, in order: readiness goes false so load
//!   balancers stop routing here, a clustered broker hands its shards to others
//!   for up to `FELIX_SHUTDOWN_HANDOFF_TIMEOUT_MS` while it keeps serving, the
//!   listener keeps admitting for
//!   `FELIX_SHUTDOWN_PREDRAIN_MS` (off by default) while they notice, then stops,
//!   in-flight connections finish, and finally the metrics server stops. Anything
//!   still running when `FELIX_SHUTDOWN_DRAIN_TIMEOUT_MS` expires is force-cancelled
//!   and named in a warning. See `felix_common::lifecycle`.
//!
//! Startup is a sequence of steps in `run_with_shutdown`, each in its own
//! submodule. Their order is load-bearing, and the comments at each step say
//! why.
