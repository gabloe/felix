//! The broker-internal transport: how brokers reach each other.
//!
//! [`PeerServer`] accepts peer connections; [`PeerPool`] makes them. Both speak
//! the protocol in `felix_wire::internal`, on their own listener, with their own
//! ALPN and their own configuration — see `docs/internal-protocol.md` for the
//! wire contract and the module docs here for what the transport guarantees.
//!
//! The transport is complete on its own terms: a request sent through the pool
//! always terminates, and an unhealthy peer cannot consume this broker. What
//! travels over it belongs elsewhere: forwarding in `serving::forward`, and
//! replication in `replication`.
