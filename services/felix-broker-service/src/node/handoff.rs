//! Handing this broker's shards to the others before it stops.
//!
//! A broker that just exits leaves each shard it leads to fail over: clients
//! are refused until the control plane notices and promotes a follower. Asking
//! the control plane to drain it first turns each of those into a planned
//! move, which clients follow without a refusal. This runs after readiness
//! goes false and before the listener closes, because a move needs the old
//! leader serving and forwarding until it cuts over.
//!
//! Best effort by design: every way it can fail (nobody to hand to, the
//! control plane unreachable, the timeout, a second signal) falls through to
//! the ordinary shutdown, and whatever is still led then fails over as it
//! always did.
