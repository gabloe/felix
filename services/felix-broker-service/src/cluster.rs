//! [`membership`] registers this node and heartbeats; [`credential`] holds the

//! metadata catalog in step with the control plane, [`node_catalog`] turns node
//! ids into addresses, and [`client_endpoints`] is what this broker tells a
//! client about where to connect. [`lease`] is the authority to serve at all:
//! renewed by the same heartbeat, checked cheaply on admission and against the
//! clock again before any record is committed.
