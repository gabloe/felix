//! The follower's side: storing records the shard's leader shipped.
//!
//! Two checks stand between a batch and this broker's disk, and they answer
//! different questions:
//!
//! 1. **May this broker store these records at all?** Decided here, from the
//!    routing view: is this node in the shard's replica set, at the epoch the
//!    sender named? A sender at an older epoch has been superseded, and its
//!    records must not be stored — it may have written them after losing the
//!    shard. That is the fence, and it is the same one the durable-append check
//!    applies on the leader.
//! 2. **Do these records belong where the batch says?** Decided by
//!    [`felix_broker::replication::apply`], against the log's own tail.
//!
//! The order matters. Position is only meaningful once the sender is
//! established as the current leader: applying first and checking after would
//! let a fenced leader's bytes reach the disk, and records are never rewritten.
