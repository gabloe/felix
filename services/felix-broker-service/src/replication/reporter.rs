//! Replica reports, batched the way the storage layer batches fsyncs.
//!
//! A report has to reach the control plane before the shard's quorum mark
//! moves, so it sits on the path of every `Quorum` publish. One POST per shard
//! per pass meant a broker leading many shards spent that path on round trips
//! that differ only in which shard they name — and the endpoint has always
//! taken a list, so they were single-element batches by habit rather than by
//! need.
//!
//! **Group commit, not a timer.** A window would add its own wait to a pass
//! that has only one shard to report, which is the common small deployment and
//! the one least able to spare it. Instead a flush takes everything queued at
//! that moment and sends it; reports arriving while that request is in flight
//! queue behind it and go together in the next one. Batches grow under load,
//! which is when they are worth having, and an idle broker waits for nothing.
//! `disk_log/sync.rs` makes the same trade for the same reason.
