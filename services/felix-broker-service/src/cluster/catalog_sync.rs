//! Broker-side control-plane sync client.
//!
//! This module runs **inside the broker service** and keeps the broker's local registries
//! (tenants / namespaces / streams / caches) aligned with the control-plane.
//!
//! Design goals
//! - Keep the **hot data path** (publish / subscribe / cache ops) free of control-plane I/O.
//! - Provide **eventual consistency**: brokers converge to the control-plane state over time.
//! - Allow a broker to cold-start with a full snapshot, then poll incremental change feeds.
//!
//! What this code assumes about the control-plane HTTP API
//! - For each resource type there is a `snapshot` endpoint that returns the full current set
//!   plus a monotonically increasing `next_seq` cursor.
//! - For each resource type there is a `changes?since=<seq>` endpoint that returns all changes
//!   after `since`, plus the new `next_seq` cursor.
//! - `next_seq` is **monotonic** per resource type (not necessarily contiguous).
//! - Change feeds are allowed to be empty; the broker will simply advance `next_seq`.
//!
//! Failure mode philosophy
//! - Snapshot/changes fetch failures are **non-fatal**: we log a warning and keep going.
//! - Local application failures (e.g., broker rejects a registration) are treated as real errors
//!   and bubble up, because they indicate an invariant mismatch or corrupted input.
//!
//! NOTE: This file is a *client* of the control-plane. Persisting control-plane data
//! (e.g., in Postgres) is implemented on the **control-plane service**, not here.

/// This function runs forever, periodically fetching control-plane snapshots and change feeds,

///
/// - It is safe to run as a background task (spawns no additional tasks).
/// - It intentionally sleeps for `interval` between change feed polls.
/// - Apply-time errors are logged and retried on the next iteration so transient
///   ordering races (for example namespace before tenant) do not stop sync.

///
/// Most callers want [`start_sync`], which is this with no signal.
///
/// A broker with durable storage uses that signal to hold readiness until its
/// streams exist. Until the first sync lands the catalog has not been applied
/// and no durable stream has been recovered — reporting ready before then
/// invites an orchestrator to route traffic at an instance whose durable
/// streams are, as far as any client can tell, missing. Pass `None` to start
/// syncing without gating anything on it.
///
/// `credential` is what the feeds are read with. They require
/// `node.view:cluster:*`, so without one every poll is refused; the holder is
/// read on each iteration, so a refresh is picked up without a restart.
