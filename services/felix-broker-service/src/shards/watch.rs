//! Broker-side view of which shards this node owns.
//!
//! Snapshot once, then follow changes from where the snapshot left off. The
//! control plane guarantees those two together describe every committed change
//! exactly once, so the interesting work here is what to do when that guarantee
//! stops holding: the broker fell behind the retention window, or the sequence
//! it was following reset under it.
//!
//! Both are recoverable, and both recover the same way — take a fresh snapshot.
//! What must never happen is carrying on from a checkpoint the control plane can
//! no longer honour, because that silently drops ownership changes and leaves
//! this broker serving shards it no longer owns.
//!
//! Changes are long-polled: the control plane holds the request until one
//! lands, so a fence or a cut-over reaches this broker as it is written rather
//! than at its next poll. A control plane that predates long-polling answers at
//! once, and the loop then waits out the interval as it always did.
