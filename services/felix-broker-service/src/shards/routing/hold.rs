//! Holding a write while its shard moves.
//!
//! A planned move leaves a gap between the fence and the cut-over in which
//! nobody serves the shard. A write that reaches a broker in that gap waits
//! here until the broker's routes show where the shard went, and then goes
//! there, instead of being refused. The wait happens before the write is
//! admitted, so nothing is acknowledged while it is held.
//!
//! Bounded twice: in time, by the window, and in how many writes may wait at
//! once, because each one holds its payload. Past either bound the write is
//! refused as `moving` and the client retries.
