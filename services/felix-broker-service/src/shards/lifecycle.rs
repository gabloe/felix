//! Local shard ownership: what this broker does about what the control plane
//! decided.
//!
//! The watch says who *should* own each shard. This says what this node has
//! actually done about it — because becoming an owner is not instant. The
//! durable log has to be opened and recovered first, and a broker that served
//! writes in that window would acknowledge records it could not yet persist.
//!
//! Ownership is therefore two-phase in both directions: `Opening` before
//! `Active`, and `Draining` before `Closed`. A shard serves only in `Active`,
//! and only at the generation the control plane currently names.
//!
//! The decision half is a pure state machine and the I/O half is a driver, for
//! the same reason placement is split that way: every interesting rule is then
//! testable without a disk.
//!
//! The phase also drives the [`fence::ShardFence`] every write passes through
//! when it claims its place in the log: open only while `Active`.
//!
//! A broker named as the destination of a move prepares the shard before it
//! is handed over, so the cut-over only has to record the new generation.
