//! send this instance traffic"; an orchestrator needs to know "should I restart
//! this process". They are different questions and the wrong answer to the
//! second is expensive: an external database outage that fails a *liveness*
//! probe restarts every instance, repeatedly, for a fault none of them caused
//! and a restart cannot fix.
//!
//! So liveness here is process-local and never touches the database, and
//! readiness is the one that can fail.
