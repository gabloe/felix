//! Prometheus metrics for cluster membership, in one place.
//!
//! Three questions come up when a cluster misbehaves, and each has an answer
//! here:
//!
//! * *Is the fleet the size I expect?* `felix_node_count` by lifecycle and
//!   region, refreshed from the same store read the node listing serves, so the
//!   dashboard and the API cannot disagree.
//! * *Did a broker just die, or was it taken out on purpose?*
//!   `felix_node_transitions_total{from,to}`. `live -> down` is a failure;
//!   `draining -> left` is a deploy.
//! * *Is this a bad broker or a bad network?* The broker-side split between
//!   rejected and unavailable, in the broker crate's `membership_metrics`.
//!
//! Every label here is bounded. Lifecycle has four values and region has as
//! many as an operator configures; neither grows with fleet size, and `node_id`
//! appears on nothing.
