//! Picking up a credential something outside the broker rewrote.
//!
//! The refresh loop covers the case where the broker renews its own token. It
//! does not cover the other one: a Vault agent, SPIRE, or a sidecar that mints
//! the credential and writes it to `FELIX_NODE_TOKEN_FILE`. That file used to be
//! read once at startup and never again, so rotation took effect on the next
//! restart and not before — while the *refresh* token file was deliberately
//! re-read every time, "so an operator who re-provisions the file by hand is
//! picked up without a restart". The asymmetry was the surprising half.
//!
//! So this watches the file and adopts what it finds, through the same
//! `ArcSwap` a refresh uses. Polling rather than inotify: the file is usually a
//! projected secret or a bind mount, where the write the broker cares about is
//! a rename or a symlink swap that filesystem notifications report
//! inconsistently across platforms and container runtimes. A poll is a `read`
//! of a small file on a slow timer, and it behaves the same everywhere.
