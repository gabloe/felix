//! The broker's authority to serve the shards it leads.
//!
//! An assignment says who *should* lead a shard. A lease says who may still act
//! on that, and it expires on its own. The difference matters because a
//! revocation cannot be delivered to a broker that is partitioned — which is
//! exactly the case where it is needed. See `docs/replication-design.md`.
//!
//! # The lease is the heartbeat
//!
//! No separate protocol. A broker renews by heartbeating, which it already
//! does, and the control plane grants by keeping the node live, which it already
//! decides. The lease is the time since the last *accepted* heartbeat, measured
//! on the broker's own monotonic clock — so the two ends never compare wall
//! clocks, and no clock synchronisation is assumed.
//!
//! # Two checks, and why they differ
//!
//! `docs/replication-design.md` requires the lease be checked when a request is
//! admitted and again before its record is committed. They are not the same
//! check:
//!
//! - **Admission** ([`LeaseState::looks_valid`]) reads one atomic and may be
//!   stale by up to the refresh interval. It sheds early and cheaply, on a path
//!   that prides itself on costing two atomic loads.
//! - **Commit** ([`LeaseState::is_valid_now`]) reads the clock. It is the
//!   authoritative one, and it is the reason a process suspended past its expiry
//!   cannot write on waking: the cached flag would still say yes, and the clock
//!   says no. It sits behind an fsync, so its cost is not measurable.
