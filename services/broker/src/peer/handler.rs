//! The owner's side: applying a publish another broker forwarded.
//!
//! Ownership is re-checked here, against this broker's own view, and the
//! requester's generation has to match it exactly. That check is the whole
//! safety property: the requester resolved against a snapshot that may already
//! be wrong, and a broker that trusted it would write a shard it no longer
//! holds.
//!
//! A mismatch in either direction is answered, never guessed at:
//!
//! - **The requester is behind** — this broker no longer owns the shard, or owns
//!   it at a newer generation. `NotLeader`, naming the current owner.
//! - **The requester is ahead** — this broker's watch has not caught up.
//!   `StaleRoute`. It must not accept: it may already have lost the shard.
//!
//! Ownership says this broker *may* write the shard; it says nothing about
//! whether the client behind the forward may. That is the second check: the
//! request carries the client's own token, and it is verified here against
//! the same keys and the same action a direct publish would be. A forwarder
//! that skipped its check, or that is not a Felix broker at all, is refused
//! `Unauthorized`, and so is one that carries no credential.
