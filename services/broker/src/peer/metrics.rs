//! Metrics for the broker-internal transport.
//!
//! These answer one question a broker can answer about itself and the control
//! plane cannot: *can this broker reach the peers it needs to forward to?* A
//! healthy cluster in the catalog says nothing about whether any given broker's
//! connections to it are up.
//!
//! Outcomes are split by kind rather than collapsed into a failure count,
//! because they call for different responses: a `handshake` failure is
//! configuration or a version mismatch, `unreachable` is the network, and
//! `timeout` is a peer that accepted the request and did not answer.
