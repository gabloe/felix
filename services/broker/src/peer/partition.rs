//! Severing two brokers while both stay alive.
//!
//! Test-only, and off unless `FELIX_PEER_PARTITION_FILE` names a file. A
//! partition is the one fault the cluster harness cannot inject from outside
//! the process: killing, stopping and freezing a broker are each a signal away,
//! but cutting the path between two brokers while both keep running -- and keep
//! heartbeating to the control plane -- needs the broker's cooperation.
//!
//! That combination is worth reaching. A leader that looks healthy to the
//! control plane and cannot reach a single follower is where a replication
//! design is most likely to be wrong, and no other fault produces it: a frozen
//! broker stops heartbeating, so the cluster notices it by other means.
//!
//! The file holds one node id per line. Empty or missing means no partition,
//! so healing is a delete and injecting is a write.
