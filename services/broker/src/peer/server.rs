//! The inbound half of the internal transport: the listener peers connect to.
//!
//! Separate from the client-facing listener, and that separation is the point.
//! Three things keep the two roles apart, in the order a connection meets them:
//!
//! 1. **A separate port.** Startup refuses a configuration where the two share
//!    one (see [`super::config::PeerTransportConfig`]).
//! 2. **ALPN.** Both ends negotiate `felix-internal/1`; the client-facing
//!    endpoint negotiates none, so there is no protocol in common and TLS
//!    refuses the handshake. A client pointed at this port never reaches frame
//!    decoding, and never touches broker state.
//! 3. **A distinct magic.** A client frame fails to decode here rather than
//!    parsing into something plausible.
//!
//! None of that is peer *authentication*, which is mTLS, #125.
