//! The distinction this module exists to preserve: a broker that deregisters is
//! `left`, and one that simply stops is found `down` by heartbeat expiry. Both
//! remove it from placement, but only the first is intentional, so only the
//! first should be silent in the logs.
//!
//! Registration happens *after* the broker can serve. Registering earlier
//! advertises a node that placement may immediately use and that cannot yet
//! answer.
