//! The binary payload decoders against arbitrary bodies.
//!
//! These are where the length and count fields live: a publish batch is a
//! tenant, a namespace, a stream, a count, and then that many length-prefixed
//! payloads. Every one of those numbers comes from the client, and every one of
//! them is a chance to size a buffer from something nobody checked.
