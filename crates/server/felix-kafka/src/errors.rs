//! Felix errors as Kafka error codes.
//!
//! Chosen for what a Kafka client does next, since that is all a code
//! controls: `NOT_LEADER_OR_FOLLOWER` makes it refresh metadata and go to the
//! new leader, `OFFSET_OUT_OF_RANGE` makes it apply its reset policy, and
//! `UNKNOWN_TOPIC_OR_PARTITION` makes it report the topic as missing, and the
//! sequence errors steer an idempotent producer.
