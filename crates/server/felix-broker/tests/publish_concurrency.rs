//! Does the broker let concurrent publishes reach the device flush together?
//!
//! `felix-storage`'s group commit coalesces properly when driven concurrently --
//! `felix-storage/tests/group_commit_fanin.rs` measures a 7.25x speedup at
//! 16-way. But an Azure session measured the fan-in actually achieved in a
//! running cluster (`felix_storage_sync_batch_appends`) at **1.004-1.007** with
//! 48 publishers, which means callers were arriving at `ensure_durable` one at
//! a time rather than together.
//!
//! Somewhere between the wire and the log, publishes are being serialised. This
//! bisects that: it drives `Broker::publish` directly, with no QUIC transport
//! and none of the service's ingress workers in the path.
//!
//! - Shared flushes here mean `felix-broker` is *not* the serialiser, and the cause
//!   is above it in `services/felix-broker-service` (the per-connection publish workers, which
//!   map a stream handle to exactly one worker via `handle.id() % worker_count`).
//! - One flush per publish here means the serialisation is in `felix-broker` itself, and
//!   this test is where to debug it.
