//! Idempotent publishes from a producer that numbers records, not batches.
//!
//! A Kafka producer gives each record of a partition the next sequence, so a
//! batch's base sequence advances by the batch's record count. Felix's log
//! expects the next batch to carry the last sequence plus one. Rather than
//! teach the log a second rule, each record is stored as a producer batch of
//! its own: record `i` of a batch carries sequence `base + i`, and the log's
//! "last plus one" is exactly Kafka's rule.
//!
//! Everything else is the log's, as for any idempotent publish (see
//! `stream/producers.rs`): the marks replicate with the records, so a promoted
//! leader or a move's destination answers a re-sent batch as a duplicate
//! instead of appending it again. The cost is a producer mark on every record
//! rather than on the first of each batch.
