//! Who a subscriber id refers to, and for how long.
//!
//! Both unregister paths work from an id captured earlier and neither holds a
//! lock across the gap: the publish fanout reaps senders it found closed after
//! releasing the log lock, and a subscription guard unregisters when it drops.
//! So the question these ask is whether an id can come to mean a different
//! subscriber than the one the caller meant — because if it can, the victim is
//! a subscriber that did nothing wrong and cannot tell it was unsubscribed.
