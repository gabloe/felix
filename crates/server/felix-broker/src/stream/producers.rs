//! Producer sequences: what lets a re-sent batch land once.
//!
//! A producer numbers its batches on a shard from zero. The shard's leader
//! keeps, per producer, the next sequence it expects and the outcome of the
//! last few it appended. A batch carrying the expected sequence is appended
//! and remembered; one carrying a sequence already remembered is answered
//! from memory and not appended; anything else is refused with a reason. That
//! is the whole mechanism, and it is what turns "the acknowledgement never
//! arrived" from a duplicate-or-loss coin toss into a safe re-send.
//!
//! On a durable stream the sequences are the log's: each batch is stored with
//! its producer and sequence, and the log keeps every producer's place (see
//! `felix-storage`'s `disk_log/producers.rs`). They replicate with the
//! records, so a promoted leader, a move's destination and a restarted broker
//! answer a re-send as the leader that took it would have. This table then
//! only serialises each producer's batches.
//!
//! An in-memory stream has no log to keep them in, so this table keeps them,
//! and they last as long as the leader does.
