//! Durable consumer-group cursors, as a projection over the log.
//!
//! A group's position is a key → latest-value mapping: the group's name to the
//! offset it will resume from. That is precisely the projection the cache
//! already is, so this is a [`LogCache`] on its own root rather than a second
//! implementation of durability, recovery, and compaction — which is what "one
//! core log, many semantics" is supposed to mean in practice.
//!
//! Its own root because a group's cursors are not user data: a cache named
//! `orders` and the group state for a stream named `orders` must not share a
//! directory. See `docs/cache-on-log.md` for the same argument about caches and
//! streams.
