//! Durable storage for streams marked `durable: true`.
//!
//! A durable stream keeps the in-memory ring buffer — cursor replay and fanout
//! still read from it, and it is what keeps non-durable performance intact — but
//! every publish is written to a disk-backed log *before* it is fanned out or
//! acknowledged.
//!
//! ## Ordering, and why it is this way
//!
//! ```text
//!   publish → append to the durable log → (fsync, if OnCommit) → fanout → ack
//! ```
//!
//! The append comes first because the alternative is unrecoverable: a record
//! delivered to subscribers and acknowledged to the publisher, but lost in a
//! crash, is a silent hole in a log that consumers believe they have read. Paying
//! the append latency before fanout means a failed write becomes a failed
//! publish, which the publisher can retry.
//!
//! The cost is real and deliberate: a durable publish carries the storage write
//! (and under `FsyncMode::OnCommit`, a device flush) inside its latency.
//! Non-durable streams never touch this path at all.
