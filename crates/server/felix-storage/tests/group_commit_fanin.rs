//! Does group commit actually group?
//!
//! Under `FsyncMode::OnCommit` the point of group commit is that concurrent
//! appends share one device flush: N publishers committing together should cost
//! roughly one flush, not N. `docs/durable-storage.md` calls this "the single
//! biggest throughput lever", and `disk_log/sync.rs` puts a number on it --
//! "the difference between a few hundred and a few tens of thousands of durable
//! appends per second on the same hardware".
//!
//! An Azure session measured the fan-in actually achieved
//! (`felix_storage_sync_batch_appends`) at **1.004-1.007** with 48 concurrent
//! publishers, against a mean flush of ~300 us -- which put a hard ceiling on
//! durable throughput at roughly one 256 KiB batch per flush. This test asks
//! the same question in-process, without a cluster: it times the same number of
//! durable appends issued serially and issued concurrently.
//!
//! If group commit is working, the concurrent run is many times faster, because
//! the flushes coalesce. If the two are comparable, the appends are serialising
//! somewhere before the flush and the fan-in is 1 by construction.
