//! Device flushes submitted to `io_uring` instead of a blocking thread.
//!
//! Every other way of issuing an `fsync` from async Rust hands the call to a
//! thread and waits for it to come back: `spawn_blocking` uses the shared pool,
//! a dedicated flusher uses one warm thread. Both keep a reactor thread free,
//! which is the point, and both cost two thread wake-ups per flush.
//!
//! `IORING_OP_FSYNC` removes the hand-off rather than making it cheaper. The
//! request goes into a submission queue, the kernel performs it, and a
//! completion arrives. No thread is parked for the duration, and — unlike
//! running the sync inline — the `await` is still a yield point, so background
//! work like rollover and retention still gets scheduled.
//!
//! One ring serves the whole process. Flushes are already serialised per log by
//! the group-commit lock, so the concurrency that matters here is *across* logs:
//! a broker with fifty shards can have fifty flushes outstanding, and on the
//! blocking pool that is fifty threads. Here it is one ring and one thread.
//!
//! That thread spends its life blocked in `submit_and_wait`, so a request that
//! arrives while other flushes are in flight has to wake it, or it sits in the
//! channel until one of them completes and one log's slow sync delays every
//! other log's. Callers ring an eventfd the thread keeps a poll armed on.
//!
//! **Measured expectations, so nobody is surprised.** On a 4-way NVMe RAID0 the
//! hand-off is about 9% of a flush (583µs with it, 530µs without), and the
//! device itself sustains ~1,346 MB/s against Felix's ~940 MB/s. This is not a
//! throughput fix; it removes a hand-off that should not be there on a
//! Linux-only server, and the dividend is small. See #547 and #548.
