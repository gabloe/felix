//! A log's own flush thread.
//!
//! An `fsync` blocks, so it cannot run on a reactor thread, but Tokio's
//! blocking pool is a poor place for it too. Every `spawn_blocking` goes
//! through one queue shared with reads, rollovers and every other shard's
//! flushes, so a flush waits behind all of them and the dispatch cost climbs
//! with the number of shards flushing at once. A thread that belongs to one
//! log and does nothing but its flushes is one channel send and one wake-up
//! away, whatever else the process is doing.
//!
//! The thread starts on the first flush and exits after `IDLE` without one,
//! so a broker holding many quiet shards does not hold a thread per shard.
//! See `docs/storage-performance.md` for the measurements.
