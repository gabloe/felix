//! Where each leadership generation began in a shard's log.
//!
//! Offsets alone cannot say where two logs part company. Both have an offset
//! 100, and "they differ at 100" says nothing about how far back they agree.
//! A generation does say, because it belongs to exactly one leader: the highest
//! generation two brokers share is the last one they cannot disagree within.
//!
//! So each shard keeps a short list of `(generation, start offset)`. It is
//! small — one entry per leadership change, not per record — and it is written
//! rather than derived, because nothing in the log itself records which leader
//! wrote a record. See `docs/replication-design.md`, "Divergence and
//! truncation".
