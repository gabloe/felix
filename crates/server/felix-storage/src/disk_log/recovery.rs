//! Bringing a shard's segments back after an unclean shutdown.
//!
//! The contract recovery upholds:
//!
//! * **A torn tail is repaired.** A crash mid-append leaves a partial record at
//!   the end of the last segment. That record was never acknowledged under any
//!   fsync policy, so it is truncated away and the log resumes at the last intact
//!   record.
//! * **Committed data is never silently discarded.** Corruption anywhere that is
//!   not the very end of the newest segment is an error at startup, naming the
//!   shard, segment and byte position. Losing acknowledged records quietly is
//!   worse than refusing to start.
//! * **Recovery is idempotent.** Opening an already recovered log changes
//!   nothing, so a crash *during* recovery is safe.
//! * **Indexes are derived, never trusted.** A missing, short or mismatched index
//!   is rebuilt from the segment it describes.
//!
//! ## What is validated, and what it costs
//!
//! Fully checksumming every segment at startup is O(bytes on disk) — minutes for
//! a large shard, which is the difference between a rolling restart and an
//! outage. So by default:
//!
//! * The **active** segment is always scanned in full. It is the only one that
//!   can have a torn tail, and it is bounded by `segment_size_bytes`.
//! * **Sealed** segments get their header validated, their index loaded, and the
//!   records after the last index entry checked — bounded by one index interval.
//!   Everything else is verified lazily, because every read verifies the checksum
//!   of every record it returns.
//!
//! Set `LogConfig::verify_all_on_open` to trade startup time for eager detection
//! of bit rot in cold data.
