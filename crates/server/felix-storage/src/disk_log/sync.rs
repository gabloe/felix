//! Durability policy: when written bytes are pushed to stable storage, and who
//! waits for it.
//!
//! The three `FsyncMode` variants differ only in *when* a flush is triggered:
//!
//! | mode                 | flush trigger                | acknowledged when          |
//! |----------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|
//! | `None`               | segment seal, shutdown       | bytes reach the page cache |
//! | `Periodic{interval}` | background timer             | bytes reach the page cache |
//! | `OnCommit`           | the append itself            | bytes reach the device     |
//!
//! ## Group commit
//!
//! `OnCommit` is the expensive one, and the reason it is affordable at all is
//! group commit. An `fsync` flushes *the whole file*, not one caller's bytes — so
//! when N appends are in flight, one flush can satisfy all N. Every appender
//! contends for the same flush lock; the winner flushes, and the losers wake to
//! find their target already durable and return without flushing again. Under
//! concurrency the device sees one flush per round trip rather than one per
//! append, which is the difference between a few hundred and a few tens of
//! thousands of durable appends per second on the same hardware.
//!
//! This is the same mechanism behind PostgreSQL's `commit_delay` group commit and
//! the WAL group-commit path in MySQL and RocksDB. `felix_storage_sync_batch_appends`
//! reports the fan-in actually achieved.
