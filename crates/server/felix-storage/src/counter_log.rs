//! A counter that is a log.
//!
//! `add` appends a signed delta record; an in-memory index holds the running
//! sum per key, rebuilt by folding the log; `get` reads the index. This is the
//! projection model the consumer-group cursors proved out — fold-over-log,
//! derived state never trusted — with addition as the fold and a checkpoint as
//! the compacted form. See `docs/projections.md` for the design.
//!
//! Deliberately beside the cache rather than inside it. A counter record is a
//! new durable shape, and mixing it into the cache's own logs would make every
//! one of those logs unreadable to a build that predates counters — including
//! a replica promoted mid-upgrade, whose *puts* would become collateral. In a
//! store of its own, the new shape's blast radius is the counters.
//!
//! Everything the cache's log bought, this inherits by construction: crash
//! safety, group commit, offsets that never rewind across compaction, and
//! replication that ships records at their offsets.
