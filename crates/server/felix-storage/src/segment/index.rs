//! The sparse offset index that sits beside each segment.
//!
//! One entry every `index_spacing_bytes` of segment data, mapping a logical
//! offset to the byte position where that record starts. A read binary-searches
//! the entries to find a floor, then scans forward a bounded distance — so
//! locating an offset costs O(log n) plus at most one spacing interval of I/O,
//! rather than a scan from the head of the log.
//!
//! Index files are an accelerator and are never trusted on their own: entries are
//! only ever used as a *starting position* for a scan that re-validates real
//! records, and any index that fails to load is rebuilt from its segment.
