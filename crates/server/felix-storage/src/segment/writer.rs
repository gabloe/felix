//! The append side of a single segment.
//!
//! A writer owns one data file plus its index and knows nothing about rollover,
//! retention, or fsync policy — it exposes `append` and `sync` and lets
//! `crate::disk_log` decide when to call them.
//!
//! Performance shape, and why:
//!
//! * **One `write` per batch, not per record.** Records are encoded into a
//!   reusable staging buffer and handed to the kernel in a single call. Syscall
//!   count is the thing that scales with batch size otherwise, and it dominates
//!   at small payloads.
//! * **`write` and `sync` are separate.** A `write` lands in the page cache and
//!   is cheap; only `sync` touches the device. Keeping them apart is what lets
//!   the log amortise one device flush across many appends (see
//!   `disk_log::sync`), which is the single largest lever on durable throughput.
//! * **Blocks are reserved up front.** See `crate::io::preallocate`.
//! * **The staging buffer is never freed.** Steady-state appends do no
//!   allocation at all beyond growing it once to the high-water batch size.
