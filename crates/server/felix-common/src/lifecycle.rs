//! Process lifecycle: termination signals, readiness gating, and bounded drain.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//! Kubernetes, systemd, and `docker stop` all terminate a process with **SIGTERM**.
//! Waiting only on `ctrl_c()` (SIGINT) means those signals fall through to the
//! default handler, which kills the process immediately and drops every in-flight
//! publish, acknowledgement, and subscription write. Every rolling update would
//! abort in-flight work.
//!
//! # Shutdown order
//! The order matters more than the individual steps:
//!
//! 1. **Readiness goes false.** Load balancers and the Kubernetes endpoints
//!    controller observe `/ready` and stop routing new traffic here. This happens
//!    before anything stops working, so clients are steered away from a healthy
//!    instance rather than discovering a broken one.
//! 2. **Stop accepting new connections.** Already-accepted work is untouched.
//! 3. **Drain, bounded by a deadline.** In-flight connections finish on their own.
//! 4. **Force-cancel whatever is left, and say what it was.** A drain that silently
//!    hangs until SIGKILL is indistinguishable from the bug it was meant to fix, so
//!    the subsystems that missed the deadline are named in the logs.
