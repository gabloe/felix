//! The small things every Felix crate agrees on.
//!
//! Deliberately thin. Something belongs here only when two crates that do not
//! depend on each other must agree on it exactly — a type crossing a process
//! boundary, or a name an operator types.
//!
//! - [`membership`] — the broker-to-control-plane shapes. These cross a
//!   process boundary as JSON, so a field renamed on one side and not the
//!   other is a silent mismatch; sharing the types puts that back in the
//!   compiler's hands.
//! - [`env_registry`] — every `FELIX_*` variable the workspace reads, so a
//!   mistyped one is reported instead of silently taking a default.
//! - [`lifecycle`] — start-up, readiness and bounded drain, shared by both
//!   service binaries. Feature-gated behind `lifecycle` so a library that
//!   never runs a process does not pull in tokio.
//! - [`ids`] and [`Error`] — the region id and its parse error.
