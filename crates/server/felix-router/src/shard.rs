//! Where a shard lives, resolved without touching the control plane.
//!
//! The publish path asks this on every request, so a lookup must not take a
//! lock a writer can hold and must never make a network call. Routes are
//! published as an immutable snapshot and swapped in whole: readers take a
//! cheap atomic load and read a table nobody can mutate underneath them, and an
//! update costs one pointer swap regardless of how many readers are in flight.
//!
//! Every outcome is explicit. There is deliberately no "not sure, handle it
//! locally": a broker that treats an unknown route as its own is a broker
//! writing a shard it does not own.
