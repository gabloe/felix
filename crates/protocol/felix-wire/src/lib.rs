//! Wire format for framing Felix protocol messages.
//!
//! Defines the frame header layout, message enums, and JSON/binary encoders
//! used by broker and client transports to communicate over QUIC.
//!
//! # Design notes
//! The format balances readability (JSON control frames) with throughput
//! (binary batch frames) while enforcing size limits for safety.
//!
//! # Module layout
//! - The client protocol: [`Frame`] and its header flags, the feature bits,
//!   the [`Message`] enum and its JSON codec, the hand-rolled [`text`] writer
//!   for the publish-batch hot path, and the [`binary`] batch codec. All but
//!   `text` and `binary` are re-exported at the crate root.
//! - [`internal`]: the protocol brokers speak to each other.
//! - [`routing`]: which shard a routing key belongs to.
