/// A batch's offsets are contiguous, so one `u64` per *batch* is enough — a

/// binary layouts had nowhere to put a key — and a perf session measured that
/// fallback at roughly 30% of throughput (#549). The key prefix goes *after* the
/// `FLAG_BINARY_PUBLISH_ACKED` prefix when both are set, so the correlation id
/// stays readable at offset 0 without parsing anything else.
///
/// An empty key is a key: it hashes like any other, and is not the same as an

/// acknowledged once the owner has written it. That is correct and invisible,
/// and the invisibility is the problem: the client keeps publishing to the same
/// entry broker forever, and every record is decrypted, re-encrypted and
/// decrypted again on the way. A perf session measured the cost at roughly half
/// the throughput per core — ~250 MB/s per busy vCPU direct against ~140
/// forwarded (#536).
///
/// So the ack says so. The bit's *presence* is the signal that forwarding
/// happened; the payload carries who to send to instead. It is a hint, not a
/// refusal — the publish already succeeded, so a client that ignores it is
/// exactly as correct as before, just as slow.
///
/// Only ever set for a client that advertised this bit in `Auth.client_flags`.
/// A client that did not would reject the whole frame, since an unknown flag
/// bit is refused rather than masked off — and it would be rejecting an

/// cannot help those older brokers, but it means the next extension fails loudly
