//! A *feature* bit is not a frame flag. Frame flags say how a payload is laid
//! out and travel on every frame; these say only that a request exists, and
//! never appear on a frame at all. They are numbered separately for that
//! reason -- sharing the space would have a client offering to receive a frame
//! shape it has no encoder for.
//!
//! A client must not send a featured request to a broker that did not advertise
//! the bit: an unrecognised message type is a fatal protocol error to the
//! broker's control loop, so probing costs the connection.

/// The broker answers `topology`: which brokers a client may connect to.
