// off the wire, so without this a ~20-byte frame declaring `u32::MAX` payloads
// reserves 95-127 GiB of address space. Overcommit means one such frame usually
// succeeds, but roughly a thousand concurrent ones exhaust the address space and
// the failing allocation calls `handle_alloc_error`, which aborts the process
// instead of unwinding — so it is not contained by per-task panic recovery. A
// memory cgroup or strict overcommit, as in a typical container deployment,
// brings that threshold far lower. The loop below still validates each payload
// individually; this only stops the count itself from being trusted.
