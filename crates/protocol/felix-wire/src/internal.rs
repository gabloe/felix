//! The protocol brokers speak to each other.
//!
//! Deliberately separate from the client protocol, and not a superset of it. A
//! client able to send `ForwardPublish` could write to a shard on a broker that
//! never checked ownership; a broker accepting client frames on its internal
//! listener would treat a peer as an authenticated publisher. The distinct magic
//! below is what makes a misdirected connection fail loudly rather than parse
//! into something plausible — it is not the security boundary, which is the
//! separate listener and peer credential.
//!
//! Flows, correlation rules, and the error table live in
//! `docs/internal-protocol.md`.
