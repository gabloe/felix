//! A stream whose shards are separate logs.
//!
//! #286. The registry used to open shard 0's log whatever shard it was asked
//! for, while the replication driver and shard lifecycle opened the real index.
//! They agreed only for shard 0, which is the only shard anything could reach —
//! so a routing key (#240) would have written a record to one log and shipped
//! another.
//!
//! Run with `cargo test -p felix-broker --test sharded_streams`.
