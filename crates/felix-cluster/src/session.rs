//! How a second terminal finds a running cluster.
//!
//! `felix-cluster up` holds a cluster in one process. Everything it needs to be
//! talked to — the broker addresses and a credential — lives in that process and
//! nowhere else, so a `publish` or `subscribe` in another window has nothing to
//! connect to. This writes it down.
//!
//! **The file contains a bearer token**, so it is written with owner-only
//! permissions and lives in the temp directory. It is a local development
//! harness whose brokers listen on loopback with dev certificates; the token is
//! no more sensitive than the cluster it opens, and that cluster disappears when
//! the process does.
