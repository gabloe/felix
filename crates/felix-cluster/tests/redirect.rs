//! Subscribing to the broker that does not own the shard.

//! #118. Before this, such a subscribe was accepted and then delivered
//! nothing -- the worst available answer, because it is indistinguishable from
//! a stream with no traffic, and an application waits forever without an error
//! to act on. `docs/subscribe-routing.md` records the decision: redirect to the
//! owner rather than proxy for it.
//!
//! Run with `cargo test -p felix-cluster --test redirect`.
