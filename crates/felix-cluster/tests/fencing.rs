//! What happens to a leader that was never told it stopped being one.
//!
//! #115's central safety criterion: *no record is acknowledged by two
//! conflicting leaders for the same logical epoch*. A killed leader cannot
//! violate it — it is gone. A **paused** one can: it is alive, it still
//! believes it holds the shard, and it comes back after the cluster has moved
//! on. That is the case worth injecting, and it is what `pause_node` exists
//! for.
