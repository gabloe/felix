//! Does group commit still group once the QUIC transport is in the path?
//!
//! Two in-process tests bracket this from below and both come out clean:
//! `felix-storage`'s group commit coalesces at 7.25x under 16-way concurrency,
//! and `felix-broker`'s publish path at 10.97x. Yet an Azure session measured
//! the fan-in actually achieved in a running cluster
//! (`felix_storage_sync_batch_appends`) at **1.004-1.007** with 48 publishers.
//!
//! Everything below the transport is therefore exonerated, which leaves
//! `services/broker`'s publish ingress. This test is the one that reaches it:
//! real brokers, real QUIC, one client connection per publisher — the same
//! shape `felix-loadgen` uses — and it reads the fan-in off the broker's own
//! metrics endpoint rather than inferring it from timings.
//!
//! Run with `cargo test -p felix-cluster --test publish_fanin -- --nocapture`.
//! `FELIX_CORE_SHARDS` and `FELIX_DURABLE_FSYNC_MODE` are inherited by the
//! spawned brokers, so the same test measures either configuration.
