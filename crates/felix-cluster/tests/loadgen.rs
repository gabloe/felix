//! The load generator, validated against a real local cluster before it is
//! trusted against a paid one.
//!
//! `felix-loadgen` is the perf suite's measuring instrument
//! (`docs/perf-real-network.md`), and an instrument nobody has calibrated
//! measures nothing: this drives each scenario against the harness's real
//! broker processes and asserts the run completes, accounts for every
//! operation, and emits the machine-readable line the Azure runner consumes.
//!
//! Numbers are asserted for *shape*, never for magnitude — this is loopback
//! on a shared CI machine, where a latency assertion would only measure the
//! neighbours.
//!
//! Run with `cargo build -p felix-loadgen && cargo test -p felix-cluster --test loadgen`.
