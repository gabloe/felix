//! A publish should stop being forwarded once the client learns the owner.
//!
//! Felix routes subscribes on the client and publishes on the server: a publish
//! for a shard the entry broker does not own is forwarded to the owner and
//! acknowledged once written. Correct, but it costs a decrypt at the entry
//! broker, a re-encrypt to the owner and a decrypt there -- measured at roughly
//! half the throughput per core (#536).
//!
//! Run with `cargo test -p felix-cluster --test publish_routing`.
