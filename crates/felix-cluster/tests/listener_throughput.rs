//! Does aggregate throughput on ONE broker move with listener count?
//!
//! `#[ignore]` — a measurement, not an assertion. Run explicitly:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo build --release -p broker --bin felix-broker
//! FELIX_INITIAL_MTU=1350 cargo test --release -p felix-cluster \
//!   --test listener_throughput -- --ignored --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! # What this can and cannot show
//!
//! The bottleneck under test is *per-datagram* work: one endpoint driver calls
//! the socket, then routes each datagram by connection id, and that task cannot
//! use more than one core.
//!
//! So the datagram count per byte decides whether the ceiling is even reachable,
//! and on loopback it is not by default: `LOOPBACK_PINNED_MTU_CAP` pins macOS
//! loopback to a 16336-byte MTU, ~11x a real path, so the driver does ~11x less
//! work per byte than it would on a network. **Set `FELIX_INITIAL_MTU` to
//! something path-like (1350) — it disables the loopback pin — or this measures
//! the wrong machine.**
//!
//! Still not a substitute for #557's Azure numbers:
//!
//! - macOS has no `recvmmsg`; quinn reads one datagram per syscall here, where
//!   the Linux measurement batches. Per-datagram cost is *higher* on this host.
//! - Generator and broker share one 16-core machine, so they compete. The Azure
//!   sessions keep them on separate VMs for exactly this reason.
//! - Loopback has no NIC, no offload, and no real RTT.
//!
//! Treat a difference here as directional evidence that the mechanism works,
//! never as the per-broker ceiling.
//!
//! # What it measured on an M4 Max (16 core), and why that settles nothing
//!
//! Flat. 1.00x / 1.00x / 1.00x / 0.98x at 1, 2, 4 and 8 listeners, with
//! `FELIX_INITIAL_MTU=1350`, 12 shards and keyed batches.
//!
//! **That is not evidence the change does nothing.** The rig never reaches the
//! regime where the endpoint driver binds:
//!
//! - **The broker is nowhere near driver-bound.** It sits at ~2.5 cores of 16
//!   with ~13 idle. The ceiling this lifts is a *single task pegged at one
//!   core*; a broker at 2.5 cores spread across many is not hitting it, so
//!   adding drivers has nothing to relieve.
//! - **The generator is the limiter, and it is in this process.** Client CPU
//!   pins at 1.08 cores and throughput at ~770 MiB/s whether 4 publishers or 32
//!   are running -- an 8x load increase moving neither. #557's session used
//!   three separate generator VMs for exactly this reason.
//! - **`AckMode::None` makes the client-side counter an enqueue rate, not a
//!   throughput.** `client-sent` reads ~770 MiB/s while the broker's own
//!   `felix_storage_append_bytes_total` reads ~543 MiB/s over the same window.
//!   Only the broker-side number is real; that gap is work the client handed
//!   off and the broker never stored.
//!
//! So the honest reading is that this host cannot discriminate. To settle #558
//! the load has to come from separate machines, on Linux, against a broker
//! driven hard enough that one endpoint driver is actually the constraint.
//!
//! One thing worth carrying into that session: broker-stored throughput drifted
//! *down* slightly as listeners rose (543 -> 527 -> 499 -> 485 MiB/s). Within
//! run-to-run spread on a rig this noisy, but if it reproduces where the
//! measurement is trustworthy, N endpoints have a cost worth knowing.
