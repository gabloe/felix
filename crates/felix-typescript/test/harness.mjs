//
// Deliberately not a mock. The claim this binding makes is that Node gets the
// *same* client behaviour Rust does — reconnection, redirect-following, offset
// accounting — and a mock would only validate the mock. So these tests start
// the real thing: `felix-cluster client-fixture` runs a control plane and
// brokers, registers what the scenarios need, and writes a JSON file saying
// how to reach them.
//
// Every test that covers a catalogued scenario names it. What each one did is
// recorded and written out as a results document, which
// `felix-conformance verify` then checks against the catalogue. A test that
// fails, errors, or never runs becomes a non-passing outcome — so the claim
// "TypeScript is conformant" is a thing the suite earns rather than asserts.
