// The Felix client conformance suite for the Node binding.
//
// One file rather than one per area, because `node --test` gives each file its
// own process: separate files would each start their own three-node cluster,
// and the ledger would be written once per process with a fraction of the
// scenarios in each. So the areas are modules that register into this file's
// suite, sharing one fixture and one ledger.
//
// The ledger is the output that matters. `FELIX_CONFORMANCE_RESULTS` names a
// file to write it to, and `felix-conformance verify` reads that file and
// answers whether every required scenario passed. A green test run that quietly
// skipped a required scenario is not conformance, which is why the verdict
// comes from the catalogue rather than from this suite's exit code.
