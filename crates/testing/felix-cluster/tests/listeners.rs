//! A broker with more than one client-facing listener.
//!
//! One UDP socket is one `quinn` endpoint, and its driver is a single task that
//! reads every datagram for that socket and routes it by connection id. That
//! task cannot use more than one core, and it is what holds a broker to
//! ~900 MB/s while the rest of the machine idles (#557). Several ports are
//! several sockets, which are several drivers -- but only if clients actually
//! spread across them, which is what these cover.
//!
//! Run with `cargo test -p felix-cluster --test listeners`.
