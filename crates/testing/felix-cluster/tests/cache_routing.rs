//! A cache whose keys are owned by different brokers.
//!
//! Every broker used to serve its own copy of every cache (#278), so a `put` on
//! one was invisible to a `get` on another — and worse, two brokers could hold
//! *different* values for one key with nothing to reconcile them. A miss is
//! detectable; divergence is not.
//!
//! These tests are written from the client's side on purpose. The unit tests
//! prove the routing decision; these prove the thing a user would notice.
//!
//! Run with `cargo test -p felix-cluster --test cache_routing`.
