//! Where records go in a multi-node cluster: forwarding across brokers,
//! redirects, keyed routing over shards, and shards moving between brokers.
//!
//! Every test here starts real broker processes; see `docs/cluster-harness.md`.
//! Run with `cargo test -p felix-cluster --test routing`, or one module with
//! `--test routing sharding::`.
