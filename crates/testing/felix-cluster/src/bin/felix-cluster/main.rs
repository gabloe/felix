//! task cluster:up
//!
//! # window 2
//! task cluster:subscribe
//!
//! # window 3
//! task cluster:publish -- hello
//! ```

//! `up` writes the addresses and a credential to a session file so the other
//! commands need nothing copied into them.
//!
//! Every line names the broker it went through and whether the record crossed a
//! node boundary, because that is the only part of this a cluster does
//! differently from a single broker.
