/// Aggregate ingest ceiling — the write throughput measured the way a
/// multi-partition system quotes it. `concurrency` publishers, each on its own
/// connection spread across the brokers, hammer `stream` (give it as many
/// shards as brokers, or more) with fire-and-forget **binary** batches and no
/// subscribers, so nothing on the delivery side can false-bottleneck the
/// number. Reports aggregate msg/s and MB/s, and the per-publisher figure so
/// scaling is visible. A single publisher on one shard is the least-parallel
/// configuration possible; this is the opposite, and it is what actually
/// stresses the brokers.
///
/// `keys` spreads batches over that many routing keys. At 0 the batches are
/// unkeyed, and a record with no key resolves to shard 0 -- so a 12-shard
/// stream is exercised as a single log, which is how every multi-shard
/// measurement before this one was really a single-shard one.
