//! The workloads, each against a remote cluster.
//!
//! Every scenario runs a warmup it discards, measures a fixed count, and
//! reports percentiles with spread — the local matrix discipline, at
//! distance. Publish payloads carry a 16-byte header (sequence, then this
//! process's monotonic nanos), so delivery latency is measured against one
//! clock: the load generator holds both ends of the pipe, which is the only
//! arrangement in which "publish to delivery" is a subtraction rather than a
//! clock-synchronisation problem.
