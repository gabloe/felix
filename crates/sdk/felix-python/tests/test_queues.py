"""Consumer groups: claim, settle, redeliver.

A queue is not a subscription with extra steps. Records are pulled because
only the consumer knows when it has capacity, each is claimed by one member
until settled, and an unsettled record comes back. These assert the settle
semantics specifically, because that is where a client that modelled a queue
as a stream goes wrong.
