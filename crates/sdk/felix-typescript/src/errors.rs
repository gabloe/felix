//! Typed errors, so JavaScript can branch on *why* something failed.
//!
//! A single error carrying prose would push callers into matching on message
//! text, which breaks the moment a message is reworded. The split here mirrors
//! the one the Python binding makes, and the one that actually changes what an
//! application does: a connection failure or an unavailable shard is worth
//! retrying, an authorization failure is not, and a write whose outcome is
//! unknown is safe to resend only when it is idempotent. A broker that
//! negotiated error codes says which it is; only an error without a code falls
//! back to reading the message.
//!
//! A napi error carries only a status from napi's own fixed `Status` enum and a
//! message, so none of this can be set as a property from here. The kind
//! travels as a message prefix and `errors.js` lifts it onto a typed
//! `FelixError` (as `kind`), along with the broker's code, retry class and
//! detail when there are any:
//!
//! ```text
//! FELIX_AUTH: <text>                               no broker code
//! FELIX_SHARD_UNAVAILABLE {"code":...}\n<text>     with one
//! ```
//!
//! Compact JSON never holds a raw newline, which is what makes the second form
//! safe to split. Both halves ship as one package, so this is an internal
//! detail rather than something a caller parses.
