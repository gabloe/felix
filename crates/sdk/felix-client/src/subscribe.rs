//! Subscriptions: [`Subscription`] and [`Event`], and the pipeline that
//! feeds them.
//!
//! A subscribe request goes out on a short-lived bi-directional stream. The
//! broker then opens a uni stream for the events, which the connection's
//! event router hands to the waiting subscription (see
//! `crate::connection`). Each subscription reads its uni stream with one I/O
//! task and decodes with one dispatch task, joined by bounded queues whose
//! overflow behaviour is the configured [`crate::ClientSubQueuePolicy`].
