//! Reading the broker's answers to acked publishes.

//! An acked publish (`AckMode` other than `None`) always carries a

//! the order they were written, so each ack must name the request at the head
//! of the queue. One that does not is a protocol error, not an out-of-order
//! arrival to wait through.
