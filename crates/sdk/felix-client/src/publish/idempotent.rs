//! A producer whose publishes land once, however many times they are sent.
//!
//! The broker hands out a producer id; the producer numbers its batches on
//! each stream from zero and sends the number with the batch. The shard's
//! leader appends the number it expects and answers a re-send of one it
//! already holds from memory, so a batch the producer never got an answer
//! for can be sent again without a second copy landing. That is the whole
//! contract, and it is what `retry.ambiguous_outcomes_are_not_silently_retried`
//! could not offer: with a sequence the ambiguous outcome is not ambiguous
//! any more.
//!
//! The sequence advances only on an acknowledgement. A publish that fails
//! for any reason but a typed refusal leaves it where it was, so the next
//! call re-sends the same batch under the same number; and a typed refusal
//! ends the producer on that stream, because a gap or a forgotten producer
//! is not something a re-send can mend.
