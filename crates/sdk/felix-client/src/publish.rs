//! Publishing: [`Publisher`], and the pool of single-writer streams behind it.
//!
//! A client opens several publish streams across its publish connections.
//! Each has exactly one writer task (`writer`) fed by a bounded queue, so
//! publishes on a stream are serialized without contending for it, and a
//! publish's bytes are admitted against a shared in-flight budget before
//! they are queued (`admission`), so a slow broker makes callers wait rather
//! than letting the client buffer without limit. `routing` picks the stream,
//! `send` encodes and enqueues, and `ack` reads the broker's answers.
