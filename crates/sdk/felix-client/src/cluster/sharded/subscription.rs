//! Every shard of a stream, read as one thing.

//! A subscription reads **one** shard: a stream's shards can have different
//! owners, and a subscription is bound to one connection to one broker. So
//! consuming a whole multi-shard stream means one subscription per shard,
//! following each shard's own redirect, and merging what comes back.
//!
//! This does that. What it deliberately does not do is pretend the result is a
//! single ordered stream — see [`ShardedSubscription`] for what is and is not
