//! A prefix watch over every shard of a cache, read as one thing.
//!
//! A cache watch reads **one** shard, and keys sharing a prefix hash to
//! different shards, so covering a prefix of a multi-shard cache means one watch
//! per shard, each on its own shard's owner. This opens them and merges what
//! comes back; each follows its shard when it moves. See [`ShardedCacheWatch`]
//! for what is and is not promised.
