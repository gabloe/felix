//! One consumer group over every shard of a stream.
//!
//! A group is bound to one shard: its cursor and its claims live with that
//! shard's leader, which is the only broker that can serve it. Consuming a
//! whole multi-shard stream through a group therefore means one group per
//! shard, each served by whichever broker leads that shard. This does that,
//! following each shard's own `NotLeader`, and hands back records tagged with
//! the shard they came from so an acknowledgement goes to the same place.
//!
//! What it deliberately does not do is merge the shards into one order: see
//! [`ShardedGroup::poll`].
