//! Consumer-group operations on one shard, sent to whichever broker leads it.
//!
//! A group's cursor and claims live with its shard's leader, and any other
//! broker answers with `NotLeader`. That includes the old leader once a move
//! has cut over, so a consumer that stays connected to one broker stops working
//! on the first rebalance unless something follows the redirect. This does,
//! and remembers where each shard was served so the next call goes straight
//! there.
