//! Cache traffic: the workers that carry requests, and cache watches.
//!
//! Each cache worker owns exactly one bi-directional stream and runs strictly
//! sequential request/response round trips on it, fed by a bounded queue that
//! pushes back on callers when the worker falls behind. Parallelism comes
//! from having several workers across several connections; see
//! `crate::connection`.
