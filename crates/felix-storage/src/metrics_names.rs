// Metric names for the durable log, in one place.
//
// Storage performance is not something you tune by reading code — you tune it by
// watching where time goes. The set below is chosen so that the three questions
// that actually come up have an answer on the dashboard:
//
// * *Is durability the bottleneck?* Compare `append_duration_seconds` against
//   `sync_duration_seconds`. If sync dominates, the fsync policy is the cost.
// * *Is group commit working?* `sync_batch_appends` is the fan-in per device
//   flush. A value near 1 under concurrent load means appends are serialising
//   on the device instead of sharing a flush.
// * *Is the periodic policy honouring its window?* `unsynced_bytes` is the data
//   at risk right now; `sync_lag_seconds` is how long the oldest unsynced byte
//   has been waiting.
//
// Names follow the `felix_` prefix already used by the broker so they land in
// the same Prometheus namespace.
