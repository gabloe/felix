"""A real cluster for the tests to talk to, and the conformance ledger.

Deliberately not a mock. The claim this binding makes is that Python gets the
*same* client behaviour Rust does — reconnection, redirect-following, offset
accounting — and a mock would only validate the mock. So these tests start the
real thing: `felix-cluster client-fixture` runs a control plane and brokers,
registers what the scenarios need, and writes a JSON file saying how to reach
them.

Every test that covers a catalogued scenario tags itself with
`@pytest.mark.scenario("<id>")`. What each one did is recorded and written out
as a results document at the end of the session, which
`felix-conformance verify` then checks against the catalogue. A test that
fails, errors, or never runs becomes a non-passing outcome — so the claim
"Python is conformant" is a thing the suite earns rather than asserts.
