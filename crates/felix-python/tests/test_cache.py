"""Cache reads, writes, counters, and watches.

The watch scenarios carry the weight here. A cache watch is what makes Felix
usable for state synchronisation rather than notification, and the parts that
make it so — resume by offset, loss reported rather than inferred — are exactly
the parts a client can appear to implement without implementing.
