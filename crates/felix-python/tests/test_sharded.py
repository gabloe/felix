"""Multi-shard subscriptions.

A subscription reads one shard. Consuming a whole stream means one per shard,
each following its own shard's owner — which is why this is the client's job
and not something the broker can do on the caller's behalf. A client that opens
shard 0 and calls it the stream loses the rest with no error anywhere.
