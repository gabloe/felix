# The broker, as a container.
#
# Built from the workspace root (`docker build -f docker/broker.Dockerfile .`),
# because the binary is a workspace member and cargo needs the workspace to
# resolve it. `.dockerignore` is what keeps that from meaning a 16GB context.
#
# Two stages: one that has a Rust toolchain, and one that does not. The runtime
# image carries the binary, a CA bundle, and an init — no compiler, no package
# manager, nothing else for an attacker to find.

# Everything, rather than a manifest-first dependency-caching dance. That trick
# needs every workspace member's manifest listed by hand, and a missed one fails
# confusingly — which is how the previous version of this file ended up
# referencing `crates/broker`, a path that has not existed since the workspace
# reorganisation. BuildKit's cache mounts below get most of the same benefit
# with none of the bookkeeping.
